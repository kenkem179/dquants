# HANDOFF — read me first, update me last

## 🟢 NOW ACTIVE (2026-06-27 pm-4): PF1 Profiler↔EA PARITY REBUILT — indicator-only, EA untouched, 0/0 → ▶ user MT5 visual check
User asked "what to improve per plans" → picked **PF1** (Profiler re-sync to 100% EA parity), then chose
**option 1: graft shared EA logic onto the rich shell, touch ONLY the Master-Volume-Profiler indicator.**
- **AUDIT (Step 1) overturned the plan's premise:** the single-source EA-twin (commits a5e2f66/9d4ea91) was
  **deliberately reverted** at `32cea71` ("restore standalone original") for visual reasons → the released
  **Profiler 1.01 was the loose STANDALONE SCOUT** (only `AccountLock.mqh`; stateless `RescanSetups`;
  breakout-only; simplified exit; **NO ProgTrail ladder**). So BOTH entry AND exit diverged from the EA, not
  just the exit. Memory [[mastervp-profiler-indicator-parity]] + BUILD-PLAN PF1 were stale on "entries already
  route through Decision.mqh." Full delta: `research/mastervp_parity/profiler_parity_2026-06-27/DELTA_AUDIT.md`.
- **FIX (Steps 2–3) DONE in `mql5/indicators/KK-MasterVP-Profiler/KK-MasterVP-Profiler.mq5`:** renamed the
  standalone's clashing symbols → `Viz*`/`InpViz*`, included the EA stack, and **rewrote `RescanSetups` as the
  EA-exact replay** (MVP_DetectSignal + MVP_DeterministicGatesPass + pure-UTC SN_* gates + one-position +
  max-trades; Engine.mqh shift map). Exit now faithful to the lock: TP1→BE→ATR-trail 2.75→**ProgTrail ladder
  2.0R/0.75/0.2**→runner cap 4.0; verdict by **realized exit R** (fixes the twin's stale WON-at-TP1-touch — the
  lock banks 0% at TP1). Rich cockpit (histogram/tick-delta/exec/net/panel) preserved as display context.
- **Compiles 0/0; EA recompiles 0/0 (untouched — only the indicator + research docs changed).** ⚠ gotchas
  baked in: pure-UTC SN funcs (no `SN_RefTime`); account-lock globals now from Inputs.mqh (deploy follow-up:
  per-account Profiler bake must target the shared lock file). Uncommitted — commit when user OKs.
- **⚡ PERF FIX (user reported severe lag / "calc takes too long" / can't scroll left):** the first cut
  re-replayed ALL history every new bar (O(rt·masterLen)) + drew one stop-path trend object per bar.
  Three fixes (still 0/0): (1) **bounded replay window** — replay only `lookStart-600 .. rt` (node decay
  0.94 warms in ~600 bars; master VP is a fresh trailing slice so signals stay exact) → O(lookback), not
  O(history); (2) **sparse staircase stop-path** — a vertex only when the SL actually moves (BE arm + each
  ladder step), ~200 objects/trade → a handful; (3) **reused VP scratch buffers** (no per-bar allocation).
  Scroll lag was dominated by the per-bar trend objects + the unbounded replay; both gone.
- **📦 RELEASES (user decided): (a) MasterVP EA RE-CUT 1.07 (no bump) — DONE + committed.** Recompiled to
  ship the new broadcast **compliance disclaimer** (`Notifier.mqh`: every Telegram/Discord/Email trade msg
  ends "Automated bot logs, not financial advice."; shared header → KenKem inherits too). Strategy/backtest
  byte-identical. Personal + Market editions in `releases/1.07/` — ▶ **user: upload `releases/1.07/market/
  KK-MasterVP-Market-1.07.ex5`**. (b) **Profiler MARKET dialog curation — mechanism BUILT + verified.** The
  parity include leaked 52 EA `input`s into the dialog; `scripts/make_profiler_market.sh` strips them (52→0,
  baked at lock defaults, copy+restore Inputs.mqh **byte-identical**) → market `.ex5` shows only the 25
  display knobs. ▶ **Profiler re-cut still GATED on the MT5 visual spot-check** — verify parity first, THEN
  run the market builder + package a versioned Profiler release (decide bump then).
- **▶ NEXT (USER, can't run headless): Step 4(ii) visual spot-check.** Recompiled `.ex5` deployed via the
  `MQL5/Indicators/KK-MasterVP-Profiler` symlink. Attach on **XAU M5 with the EA lock `.set`**; confirm entry
  markers land on the EA backtest's entry candles AND the WON/LOST/BE verdict + stop path match a sample of
  realized trades. (Daily-DD is the one gate the indicator can't reproduce — needs live equity; documented.)
  ▶ ME: commit on user OK; optional dialog-curation (Inputs.mqh adds ~51 EA inputs to the Profiler dialog).

## 🟡 (prior, 2026-06-27 pm-3): BTC RECONCILED — NOT dead, REGIME-DEPENDENT edge (user's production was right)
User reported BTC profitable in live deployment + emphasized BE-after-TP1. Both verified TRUE.
- **Deployed config (`releases/1.07/KK-MasterVP-1.07-btcusd-m5.set`) = byte-identical key params to the
  engine lock I tested** → my arm A IS production. Period breakdown (`recent.py`): **2025H1 −3,986/PF0.76
  (the ONLY losing stretch); 2025H2 +375/1.04; 2026 +1,718/1.14 → +2,093 since mid-2025.** Live profit is
  REAL and matches backtest. The "CLOSE BTC, no edge" framing was OVER-ABSOLUTE — it's a regime-dependent
  edge (works trending/recovery, bleeds in 2025-H1 down-grind), not dead.
- **BE-after-TP1 ESSENTIAL (user right):** BASE −1,892 vs BE-off −2,679 = **+787 net**, SL-WIN 228→682,
  FLIPS 2025H2 positive. Was `true` in every tested config (tested correctly). Distinct from partial-banking
  (close-% at TP1) which DOES hurt. Ladder Trigger=1.0 worse than BASE (early-arm choke; late-arm 2.0R better).
- **▶ OPEN LEVER (constructive, offered to user): a regime / equity-drawdown STAND-DOWN guard** to sit out
  2025-H1-type bleeds while staying live in trending regimes — turns the real recent edge into a deployable
  one. NOT more param sweeps (exhausted). ⚠️ engine over-credits BTC → live thinner than +1,718.

## 🔴 (prior pm-2): BTC exit-geometry RE-SWEEP — XAU exit helps M5 (−1892→−1223) but full-window still <PF1
User correctly flagged the BTC "no edge" verdict used the **abandoned `RunnerRr=10`/wide-trail/no-ladder**
exit, NOT the proven XAU M5 geometry (capped RR 3.2/4.0 + late-arm ProgTrail ladder). Re-tested with the
proven exit transplanted onto the SAME BTC entries (`research/mastervp_parity/btc_exit_resweep_2026-06-27/`).
- **Baseline VALIDATED** (arm A reproduces revisit 1232 tr / −1892 exactly; bugs fixed = needed `--set-all`
  + `--symbol-btc` + `--trade-from-ms 1735689600000`).
- **Result: the proven exit HELPS but does NOT rescue.** BTC M5 best = RR3.2/partial0/ladder **PF 0.980 /
  net −1,223** (improved from −1,892 / 0.952, ~35% less loss + lower DD) — STILL a loser, never PF>1.
  M3 still −9,981 / 100% DD. **Partial-banking HURTS BTC too** (monotone p0>p20>p33, same as XAU — XAU lock
  is `InpTp1ClosePct=0`; stability = ladder+capped-RR, NOT partial). **Binding constraint = ENTRY quality**
  (exit-agnostic mfeR median ~0.85R, 43% reach 1R) — no exit fixes entries that don't run.
- **▶ BTC stays CLOSED** (now with the exit confound eliminated). No MT5 run warranted (loser in the
  optimistic engine). XAU M5 (MasterVP) + XAU M1 (KenKem D5-E4Long) remain the only validated edges.
  Tools: `ab.py` (A/B+mfeR), `sweep2.py` (RR×partial+M3). [[btc-no-robust-edge-closed]].

## 🔴 (prior, 2026-06-27 pm): KenKem M3 (K1 lever) — TESTED → REJECT. KenKem M1 D5-E4Long stays sole edge.
User asked for a path to a profitable KenKem from E1/E2/E5 + combos, "accept M1 parity is hard, do M3/M5
instead", thoroughly-swept-and-locked-only. Probed + swept the **K1 M3 lever** end-to-end this session.
- **Engine constraint found:** kenkem `tick_backtester` is hardwired M1-base (resamples ×3/×5/×15). Feeding
  the **M3 bars file** to `--bars-m1` = SAME strategy on a **3× clock** (base M3, HTF M9/M15/M45). Faithful
  research proxy; built full-window `bars_xauusd_2024_2026_m3.csv` (283,960 bars from the lock's M1 bars).
  ⚠️ MT5 lacks M9/M45 → a proxy winner would need engine-generalization to deploy (never reached).
- **Result = REJECT** (`research/kenkem_parity/m3_sweep/M3_SWEEP_FINDINGS_2026-06-27.md`):
  (1) sample size NOT the blocker (217 tr full / 172 train ≫ MinTRL 122; M3 is E1-dominant, E2/E4 vanish);
  (2) only lever that moves train PF = **RR rescale** (1.9→5.5 → train PF 1.36, heals train dead-quarters)
  — **the user's strict-alignment + gate-recalibration hypothesis did NOT pan out** (gate/alignment no help);
  (3) **RR lift OVERFITS — OOS PF 0.81–0.88 net-negative at EVERY RR** (2026Q1 −534 collapse); (4) worse
  than M1 on the FULL window too (PF 1.22 vs 1.33, net 1.6k vs 3.5k, **maxDD 1391 vs 512**); (5) degenerate
  trailing artifact (10/222 TP at RR5.5). Apples-to-apples bar = M1 lock TRAIN PF 1.146 (its 1.428 was the
  held-out 2025Q4). Fails build-plan decision rule on PF+robustness+DD → logged tested→reject, no code change.
- **▶ RECOMMENDATION: accept KenKem M1-only.** The two validated, released products stand: **KK-MasterVP XAU
  M5 (1.07)** + **KK-KenKem XAU M1 D5-E4Long (1.03)**. E5-on-M1 parity = still the 52.8% tar-pit (below).
  Only open M3 thread (LOW prior, costly) = engine-generalized MT5-native HTF stack (M5/M15/M30) — do NOT
  pursue without explicit go. Repro: `research/kenkem_parity/m3_sweep/{sweep,validate}.py`. Tools committed.

## 🔵 (prior) KenKem — lock edge-autopsy DONE; E5-parity path assessed (HARD), awaiting steer
User direction this session: MasterVP XAU locked+released (1.07, converged); BTC revisited+**CLOSED** (below);
pivoted to **KenKem**. Did the pre-sweep edge-autopsy + assessed the user-chosen "add sample via E5 parity" path.
- **LOCK EDGE-AUTOPSY (commit 4a291e9, `research/kenkem_parity/LOCK_EDGE_AUTOPSY_2026-06-27.md`):** lock repro
  n=141/net+1,988/PF1.517/maxDD 4.8%. Edge REAL but NARROW: **87% of net from 2025Q4**, tail-heavy (top-10=88%).
  Weak spot = **2025Q3** (highest-volume quarter yet net LOSER PF 0.83 = over-trades chop). EA-exit −623 leak is
  CORRECT loss-cutting (mfeR 0.35, never green), ~all E2 stall-outs → exit-tuning is NOT the lever. Both leaks
  share ONE root: **E2/chop entries that never develop**. ⚠️ **n=141, MinTRL~122 → any sweep that cuts n breaks
  the gate**; MasterVP-style 40-lever sweep = overfitting machine here. Optimization must be surgical+per-quarter+gated.
- **E5-PARITY PATH = HARD, stuck at 52.8% recall ceiling** (authoritative: `E5_REALTRACE_FINDINGS.md` +
  `E5_2026_GATETRACE_FINDINGS.md`). All cheap hypotheses killed (config/limit/pip-tol/ATR/forming-ADX). Residual
  51 missed = **42 M1 onset BAR-PAIRING** (engine arms @B-2, MT5 effective @B-1; EMA VALUES match exactly). Naive
  shift REGRESSES (52.8→41.7%, net −617→−1231; arming+fire coupled, B-2 net-best). Correct fix needs EA latch
  internals (`m_prevBullishAligned`/`m_lastBullishSignal`) → add RealTrace cols (kenkem repo) + **a new user MT5
  E5-only realtrace run** + precise engine port, regression risk, payoff uncertain (best ~70%, maybe still untrust-
  worthy). Explore-agent's "sideways-gate missing / pip-tol hypothesis" claims were WRONG (verified in code: line
  155 `entries.hpp` already gates E5 sideways; pip-tol killed in gatetrace doc). The +466-net missed edge is real.
- **USER CHOSE option B (instrument EA + MT5 run). ✅ DONE this session — now BLOCKED on the user's MT5 run.**
  Added 4 onset-latch columns to the EA realtrace (`prev_aligned_bull/bear` = the m_prev*Aligned the onset
  compared against, captured before the once-per-bar overwrite via PERSISTENT members `m_rtPrevBull/Bear`;
  `last_bull_signal/bear_signal` = armed-bar index). Files: `kenkem/MQL5/Experts/KenKem/Parity/RealTrace.mqh`
  + `Entries/Entry5.mqh` (NOT committed in kenkem repo — user manages it; compiled into the live `.ex5`).
  ⚠️ The realtrace-wired EA is **`KenKemExpert.mq5`** (v1.8.154, includes RealTrace@41) — NOT the `-1.8.154-dev`
  snapshot (no RealTrace include, won't compile headless). **Compiled 0 errors → `kenkem/MQL5/Experts/KenKem/
  KenKemExpert.ex5`** (kenkem/MQL5 is the live MT5 data folder, symlinked into the wine MT5 as `Experts/KenKem`).
  reproduce.set staged + synced: load **`dquants/KK-KenKem/KK-KenKem-E5only-2026H1-RealTrace.set`**.
- **✅ MT5 RUN DONE + DECODED (commit 1ac66f5, `E5_ONSET_LATCH_FINDINGS_2026-06-27.md`).** Collected 108 E5
  (=MT5 truth) w/ the 4 latch cols; diffed vs engine onset valdump. **PROVEN:** (1) EA reads alignment at
  **B-1** not engine's faithful B-2 (ema25 exact 375/375); (2) EA's prev is a **STATEFUL latch that FREEZES
  during low-ADX gaps** — all 120 onset mismatches follow a >5-min non-armed gap (median 208); the freeze =
  Entry5.mqh:148 ADX early-return skipping the once-per-bar latch update. (3) Naive stateful B-1 latch
  reproduces only **69%** (≈ the blind shift that REGRESSED); engine-ADX gating doesn't close it (EA froze on
  its OWN forming-ADX, not logged on skipped bars). Tools in the RUN folder (`e5_pairing/adxlatch/mismatch.py`).
- **▶ FORK (user decision — E5 stays OFF meanwhile):** (A) attempt engine port = read B-1 + freeze prev-latch
  when the engine's E5 ADX/session gate fails (toggle default-OFF), let the BACKTEST judge on 2026 AND 2025
  (medium effort, uncertain — engine-ADX≠EA-ADX where it froze); (B) one more realtrace round logging EVERY
  bar's alignment+forming-ADX → exact port (needs another MT5 run); (C) accept the 52.8% ceiling, E5 OFF,
  pivot to the **surgical E2/chop sweep** on the existing lock (`LOCK_EDGE_AUTOPSY_2026-06-27.md`, doesn't need
  E5 parity). Memories: [[kenkem-e5-2026-selection-break]], [[kenkem-e5-onset-trap-fix]], [[kenkem-atr-is-sma-not-wilder]].

## ❌ BTC REVISIT (Monster/BTC) — NO ROBUST EDGE, CLOSED — DONE 2026-06-27
Revisited whether ANY BTCUSD edge is salvageable (Monster=retired, merged into MasterVP). **Verdict: CLOSE BTC.**
- **M3 dead** (H7: overfit, OOS-catastrophic). **M5 = full-window LOSER** (Jan25–Jun26 net −1,892, bal 8,107),
  MT5-disconfirms (engine 1.293 vs MT5 **1.058**), WF 3/6 folds+ (alternating −+−++−, MOST-RECENT fold negative).
- **Per-trade regime autopsy (n=1232, pre-registered vars)**: ADX/diSpread/brkDistAtr/spreadAtr all NON-monotone;
  2025 (H1) negative across every cell — the losing periods are unconditioned variance, not a tradeable regime.
  Only `runwayAtr` is monotone (low-runway better) but economically BACKWARDS for a trend-runner, leaves the
  recent fold negative, rescues only 2025H1, and BTC engine P&L MT5-erases → does NOT graduate to a build.
- No code change; BTC presets stay as research history (header already says not release-grade). Findings +
  repro `research/mastervp_parity/btc_revisit_2026-06-27/` (`FINDINGS.md`, `btc_m5_regime_autopsy.py`).
  **▶ No open BTC lever.** Updated [[best-experts-release-table]] (BTC rows → CLOSED).

## ❌ H12c nodeNet ABSORPTION VETO — MT5 VERDICT = REJECT (catastrophic) + EXPOSED a node-net parity gap — DONE 2026-06-27
Built C+++MQL, engine A/B failed the lock bar, MT5 A/B settled it: **REJECT, infra stays inert default-OFF.**
- **MT5 (plain backtest of `…-H12c-NodeVeto-ON.set`, KK-MasterVP-Debug, XAU M5, 2025.06.01–2026.05.29, 10k):**
  veto ON = **net 4,393 / PF 1.212 / 386 tr / DD 16.7%** vs lock OFF **90,781 / 1.448 / 1425 / 14.5%** →
  **net −95%, 73% of trades removed, PF down, DD WORSE.** Catastrophic.
- **It exposed a NODE-NET PARITY GAP.** The MQL veto logic is CORRECT (exported trades: all kept breakouts
  along≥0; only kept along<0 are reversion, which the veto doesn't touch). But **MT5 flags ~74% of breakouts as
  along<0** (node-net against) vs the C++ engine's **~15%** — the decayed-VP node-net VALUE at VAH/VAL differs
  systematically MQL↔C++ even though `(b−s)/max(b+s,1)` is byte-identical. Suspect: EA feeds `iVolume`
  (MT5 tick-vol) to the node bins vs engine's imported `tick_count` → different decay-window buy/sell weighting.
  Never caught before: lock runs `node_gate_enabled=false` + no shipped feature ever used the node-net *value*
  (gate uses absorbed/state; conviction-protect default-OFF). The veto is the FIRST value-consumer → surfaced it.
- **Decision:** REJECT. NOT worth root-causing the parity gap to rescue the veto — even at perfect parity the
  engine A/B showed NO pooled-PF edge + worst-fold degradation (ceiling = a DD-dial). ⚠️ **FUTURE RULE: any new
  feature depending on the node-net VALUE (not just absorbed/state) MUST first prove per-entry MQL↔C++ node-net
  parity — this run is evidence it does NOT currently hold.** MT5-optimizer note: it won't iterate a 2-point/bool
  axis (1 pass); use a plain backtest or two single-value `.set` for bool A/Bs.
- Infra default-OFF, lock byte-identical (confirmed). Commits b8df923 (build), c4f21a0 (step-0 fix+hook),
  + this verdict. Findings `research/mastervp_parity/node_absorb_veto_2026-06-27/` (+ `mt5_runs/`).
  [[mastervp-h12-entry-flow-veto-rejected]]. **▶ No open MasterVP research lever** (H7/H10c/H12/H12b/H12c all closed).

<details><summary>(history) H12c pre-MT5 build + engine A/B detail</summary>

Veto = skip a breakout when the decayed VP node-net at the level being broken is AGAINST the trade
(`along = is_long?ns_vah.net:-ns_val.net < 0`).
- **DEPLOYABILITY = ✅ SHIPPABLE** (the open caveat, cleared): the decayed VP node engine is a faithful 1:1
  port already LIVE in the MQL EA (`VP-Common/NodeEngine.mqh`; `nsVah/nsVal.net` computed in `Engine.mqh`,
  passed to `MVP_DetectSignal`). Veto ports as a THIN gate, not engine-only.
- **BUILT default-OFF both engines, byte-identical:** C++ `enable_node_absorb_veto`/`node_absorb_veto_min`
  (config+strategy.hpp) + MQL `InpEnableNodeAbsorbVeto`/`InpNodeAbsorbVetoMin` (Strategy.mqh + Inputs.mqh
  KK_IN=hidden-in-prod/exposed-in-Debug). Both EAs compile 0/0; `make test` 37+240+13 green; HEAD-ref vs veto
  binary trade-diff empty; WF BASELINE==`{false}` n=1400. (Prod market surface unchanged — KK_IN hidden global.)
- **ENGINE A/B (6-fold WF xau-m5, lock base) → REJECT for engine lock.** OFF: pooled PF **1.330**/net 23,140/
  dd 6.4%/Calmar 3,616/worstPF **1.279** (n1400). ON: PF 1.329/net 19,285/**dd 4.9%**/**Calmar 3,936**/worstPF
  1.137 (n1197). Removes 203 against-absorption entries → DD+Calmar IMPROVE but **pooled PF FLAT, net −16.7%,
  worst-fold PF DEGRADES** (F2 1.32→1.23, F6 1.29→1.14). Fails the T1 rule = a DD-dial at net+robustness cost.
- **▶ THE OPEN DECISION (user): is it worth ONE MT5 A/B?** The model-free autopsy (trustworthy) says these
  entries ARE worse; the engine OVER-credits runner P&L (the exact quantity behind the −16.7% net-cost), so MT5
  could shrink the cost while keeping the DD win. Drop-in shipped: **`KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5-H12c-NodeVeto-AB.set`**
  (KK-MasterVP-**Debug** EA, XAUUSD M5, every-tick real ticks, 2025.06.01–2026.05.29, dep 10k, rank PF; optimizes
  `InpEnableNodeAbsorbVeto` over {false,true}, `InpNodeAbsorbVetoMin=0` fixed — do NOT sweep Min). Adopt only if
  B holds PF≥lock AND improves DD w/o worst-period collapse; else infra stays inert default-OFF (like H12/H12b/H10c).

## 🧨 H7 BTC M3 DEDICATED SWEEP → NO ROBUST EDGE (overfit, OOS-catastrophic) — DONE 2026-06-27
The genuine BTC-M3 sweep (the old "no edge" run used the BTC-M5 lock on M3 bars). Master length, ADX, trail,
SL all swept on real M3 bars. TRAIN Aug–Nov 2025 / OOS Jan–Jun 2026, `m3_base_btc.set`, `sweep.py`.
- Baseline = disaster (PF 0.75 train / 0.83 OOS, ~80% DD). S1: best region master **6 (720b/36h)** + ADX≥30
  (still PF<1). S2: crosses PF>1 only with a VERY WIDE trail → train-best master6/ADX30/**trail8/SL1.5 = PF
  1.090 / +2,300 / DD18.3%**. But trail8 is near grid-edge (overfit flag).
- **🧨 OOS = COLLAPSE: train-best → OOS PF 0.668 / −7,980 / 81% DD.** Train↑⇒OOS↓ anti-correlated = pure overfit.
  OOS-direct broad scan (12 combos master×ADX×trail×SL): **ZERO PF>1** → not a wrong-region pick; the whole OOS
  surface is sub-1. **REJECT — do NOT ship a BTC-M3 lock.** XAU M5 stays the sole validated MasterVP edge; BTC's
  only non-dead TF is M5 (breakeven-marginal). Results `research/mastervp_parity/btc_m3_sweep_2026-06-27/`. No code change.
- **▶ HIGHEST-VALUE OPEN LEVER NOW = the nodeNet structural-absorption veto (H12c — the session's one autopsy
  PASS):** entries breaking into a net-sold level underperform robustly on BOTH years. Build `enable_node_absorb_veto`
  (skip when nodeNet-along<0) — BUT first check DEPLOYABILITY (decayed VP node engine must be live in the MQL EA),
  then engine A/B → per-fold WF → gate → MT5. See [[mastervp-h12-entry-flow-veto-rejected]] (H12c section).

## 🔬 H12 ENTRY-FLOW EXHAUSTION VETO — BUILT default-OFF + AUTOPSY-REJECTED (2026-06-27)
User's REAL idea (not the giveback patch): after enough breakouts beyond mVAH/mVAL, flow exhausts → veto a
geometrically-valid entry when the **near-price net tick-vol delta within ±2.4×ATR** is AGAINST it. Built the
EXACT measure + ran the model-free autopsy gate BEFORE any sweep (CLAUDE.md doctrine). **Verdict: the literal
mechanism does NOT validate — built default-OFF, byte-identical, NOT swept.**
- **Measure:** `near_price_net_at()` in `cpp_core/include/kk/common/tf_net.hpp` = (buy−sell)/(buy+sell) of the
  last `entry_flow_look`(=50) bars whose hlc3 ∈ ±`entry_flow_veto_atr`(=2.4)×ATR of the signal-bar close, [−1,+1],
  no-lookahead. Params `enable_entry_flow_veto`(OFF)/`entry_flow_veto_atr`/`entry_flow_veto_min`/`entry_flow_look`.
  Journaled per trade as `entryFlowNear` (new trades-CSV col). Veto sits after net-persist in `tick_engine.hpp`.
- **Autopsy (2117 lock entries, XAU M5 full 2025–2026, model-free mfeR/reach1R — exit model NOT trusted):**
  near-price flow is ~always WITH the breakout (median +0.28; only ~10% against). The against-flow entries are
  EQUAL-or-BETTER (mfeR 1.306 vs 1.272, reach1R 46.2% vs 41.8%, smaller maeR) → they're favorable PULLBACK
  entries, not traps. Holds even on EXTENDED (top-Q brkDist) breakouts. A veto would remove good trades.
- **H12b FADING-VOLUME (magnitude) veto — ALSO REJECT (2026-06-27, pure-Python no engine change):** the literal
  "volume dies out" = skip low/declining-participation breakouts. 3 measures quartiled (breakout-bar rel volume,
  participation slope, near-price partic frac): LOW/dying-volume breakouts are EQUAL-or-BETTER (model-free
  mfeR/reach1R), NOT traps. Faint INVERSE hint (surging volume=climactic=weaker), weak+exit-model-tinged, not chased.
  ⇒ BOTH direction (H12) and magnitude (H12b) vetoes reject. Repro `entry_flow_veto_2026-06-27/fading_volume_autopsy.py`.
- **The proxy that flickered = a DIFFERENT quantity:** `nodeNet` (VP-node structural absorption at the breakout
  price) — mild-against entries −26/tr w/ lower mfeR, but WEAK + non-monotone. Separate hypothesis, NOT pursued.
- **Verified:** default OFF → trades byte-identical to the lock (behavioral trade-diff vs HEAD empty; same 2117
  trades/balance); `make test` green; backtester rebuilt. Results `research/mastervp_parity/entry_flow_veto_2026-06-27/`.
- **▶ STATE:** entry-exhaustion intuition tested 2 ways (direction H12 + magnitude H12b) → BOTH reject on XAU.
  Only `nodeNet` structural-absorption flickered (weak/non-monotone, NOT pursued). Next open MasterVP lever =
  **H7 (BTC M3, never properly swept)** unless user wants the nodeNet autopsy. Committed this session.

## ✅ H10c SESSION-GIVEBACK STOP — BUILT + MT5-TESTED → REJECT (2026-06-26) — DONE, no deploy change
User's standing "MasterVP chases breakouts, gives good trades back to the market" thrust. Built default-OFF
`InpGivebackPct` (halt NEW entries after handing back ≥X% of the day's peak GAIN, never truncates the open
runner) → **MT5 optimizer verdict: REJECT.** XAU M5, 2025.06–2026.05, dep 10k, rank PF, `InpGivebackPct ∈
{0…90}`, 0=OFF control in-run (parsed from `.opt` via `scripts/parse_mt5_opt.py`):
- **OFF wins on EVERY axis: Net 90,781 / PF 1.448 / 1425 tr / DD 14.5%** (= the ProgTrail lock exactly →
  parser validated). Every giveback value collapses net **~92%** (~$4–8k): stand-down cuts trades
  1425→322–510 (removes the fat-tail days) AND *raises* maxDD to **22–26%** — fails even the "stopped clock
  lowers DD" consolation. No plateau, nothing near the lock.
- **4th independent falsification of "don't give it back" on XAU** (after 7 profit-locks, flow-exit, H10b
  entry-cap): a giving-back day is indistinguishable IN ADVANCE from a pausing-then-running day. Only the
  **ProgTrail late-arm ladder** (already locked, 1.07, +3.4%) works on XAU. Giveback = opportunity cost, not
  capital risk (BE arm caps downside). Results `research/mastervp_parity/H10c_results/` (FINDINGS + csv + .opt).
- **Infra stays in tree, default-OFF, byte-identical** (trade-diff vs HEAD empty; `make test` 37+240 green;
  both EAs compile 0/0; market surface unchanged). May help a mean-reverting instrument; closed on XAU.
- **▶ NEXT open MasterVP lever: H7 (BTC M3 — never properly swept; old "no edge" run used M5 params on M3
  bars).** Build detail committed `83bd7aa`; Presets-symlink fix `5685c7d`; verdict commit this session.

## 🟢 H9 MT5 OPTIMIZER RESULTS IN (2026-06-26 pm) — A=lock holds · B=INVALID · C=WINNER candidate (ProgTrail late-arm)
User ran Grids A, B, C on the MT5 optimizer (KK-MasterVP-Debug, XAU M5, real ticks, 2025.06.01–2026.05.29,
10k). MT5 writes no XML to disk except one manual export; results live in binary `Tester/cache/*.opt`. I
reverse-engineered the `.opt` layout and parse it via **`scripts/parse_mt5_opt.py`** (records at file tail,
REC=280+8·n_params; validated by reproducing Run A's ReportOptimizer XML exactly). Results +
CSVs: **`research/mastervp_parity/H9_results/`** (`FINDINGS.md` + per-grid CSV).
- **A (Partial-TP, 30 passes) → LOCK HOLDS.** Winner = `InpTp1ClosePct=0` (87,838/PF1.436/DD14.5). Banking
  any % strictly lowers PF. Partial-TP rejected again.
- **B (BE×Trail×RR, 80 passes) → ⚠️ INVALID, RE-RUN.** Was run with `InpPmProgTrail=true` left ON at the bad
  default ladder (1.0/0.5/0.1) in the base → every pass had a runner-choking ladder. PROOF: B's lock-coord
  row `(0.02,4.0,2.75)`=`64386.51/1.3698/1427/DD20.05` is BYTE-IDENTICAL to C's `(1.0/0.5/0.1)` row. B tells
  us nothing about pure exit geometry. **Re-run B with `InpPmProgTrail=false`** (optional — see C).
- **C (ProgTrail ladder, 36 passes) → 🟢 WINNER CANDIDATE.** 16/36 beat lock PF. Clean signal: **arm the
  ladder LATE (Trigger=2.0R)** — all Trig-2.0 passes dominate; Trig-1.0 (early) is worst (the same choke that
  killed B). Flat plateau (Trig2.0, Inc≥0.5): 8 configs within PF 0.010, net 86.6–91.0k, DD 14.4–14.5, ~1425
  tr (entries unchanged = pure exit win). Best `2.0/0.75/0.3`=90,097/**1.450**/DD14.4 BEATS lock
  (87,838/1.436/14.5) on PF + net + DD. Central pick: **Trigger 2.0 / Increment 0.75 / Step 0.2**
  (90,781/1.448/DD14.5).
- **✅ LOCKED 2026-06-26 — ProgTrail late-arm ladder added to XAU M5 lock.** Winner **Trigger 2.0 / Inc 0.75
  / Step 0.2**. MT5 full-run head-to-head (Debug EA, real ticks, 2025.06–2026.05, $10k), lock→candidate:
  FULL PF 1.4127→**1.4246** (+$2,806/+3.4%); 2026 1.4372→**1.4581** (+$3,165); 2025H2 1.3671→1.3617
  (−$359, ladder near-inert). Gate **DSR 1.000 PASS** (n_trials=36, sr_trial_std 0.0135). 5 MT5 runs total
  collected to `research/mastervp_parity/H9_results/` (full+2 sub-folds for cand & lock).
- **⚠️ DEPLOYMENT TRAP resolved:** `InpPmProg*` are HIDDEN globals in the prod EA (`.set` can't drive them;
  only Debug EA exposes them — log-confirmed validation ran on Debug). FIX: baked the 4 ladder values as
  compiled DEFAULTS in `Inputs.mqh` + recompiled `KK-MasterVP.ex5` (0/0). `.set` (M5.set) also updated +
  header rewritten; best-experts table updated.
- **✅ PROD-EA CONFIRMED + RELEASED 1.07 (commit f881d3b).** Production `KK-MasterVP.ex5` full-run reproduced
  the lock EXACTLY: 1423 tr / net 86,034.50 / PF 1.4246 (log-confirmed it ran `KK-MasterVP.ex5`, not Debug).
  `make release` → v1.06→**1.07**, personal + MQL5-Market editions + all .set variants packaged under
  `releases/1.07/`. **XAU M5 lock = DONE.** Optional follow-up: demo forward-test before promoting 1.07 live.
- ⚠️ **Collection note:** to hand me an optimization result, either (a) leave the `.opt` in MT5 cache and I
  parse it, or (b) right-click Optimization Results → Export to XML. The `.opt` parser is the reliable path now.

## ⚡ AUTOPILOT 2026-06-26 (pm) — "SAFER EA" thrust: release allowlist + H10a/H10b/H11 (commits 8fbb815, e983755)
**Context:** user doubts the laddered-TP lock + wants a "don't give profit back / no over-trading" safety
mechanism, and asked me to (1) pin the marketplace param surface so I can sweep freely, then (2) autopilot the
research while they run the #1 MT5 item. Done this session:
- **Marketplace surface PINNED (commit 8fbb815).** Added `KK-MasterVP/release.market.whitelist` (40 user-facing
  keys) → release strips any non-listed `input`, so I can now expose ANY param as `input` in dev/Debug without
  it leaking to the buyer dialog. Fixed 2 latent bugs in `scripts/lib/market_edition.sh` (no-space `name= val`
  extraction that would've hidden `InpSoftBlockLotMult`; force-hide subtraction in whitelist branch). **Verified
  market binary stays dialog-identical** (simulated transform diff). Not re-cut yet (avoid disturbing in-flight
  1.06 upload) — next market re-cut picks it up.
- **H10a DONE — distance anti-chase stays OFF.** Re-swept `InpBreakMaxAtr` under the CURRENT RR4.0/Trail2.75
  lock; OFF dominates every axis (PF 1.366/net 30,172/dd 11.6%/Calmar 6.37, monotonic). My earlier "stale verdict"
  worry didn't change the answer.
- **H10b DONE — entry trade-count/streak cap REJECTED; giveback is an EXIT problem.** Model-independent `mfeR`
  autopsy: per-trade edge FLAT across intra-day index, win/loss streak, and distance (far Q = best edge). A
  ≤3W/≤2L entry cap forfeits ~1.3R/skip. BUT realized USD collapses on already-green days (10.7 vs 60.8) while
  `mfeR` stays 1.24 → the giveback the user senses is real but exit-side → fix via H10c/H10d, MT5-judged.
- **H11 DONE — shipped `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5-Conservative.set`** (lock w/ `InpRiskAccPct` 1.0→0.5; zero-edge-cost
  DD dial).
- **▶ NEXT (me, autopilot):** build **H10c** = default-OFF SESSION-level giveback stop (stop NEW entries after
  giving back X% of day-peak equity; must NOT truncate the live runner — prior per-trade rescue lost net
  [[mastervp-flow-exit-rejected]]) in C++ tick engine + MQL, golden-parity, then `.set` grids for MT5. Then H10d
  = RR/trail (= H9 Grid B). Tools: scratchpad `h10a_brkmax.log`, `h10b_autopsy.py`.
- **▶ USER (the only-you items, ranked):** (1) run **H9 MT5 optimizer grids** A→C→B on `KK-MasterVP-Debug`,
  XAUUSD M5, every-tick real ticks, 2025.06.01–2026.05.29, dep 10k, rank by PF (settles laddered TP + "trailed
  too far"); (2) D1–D3 demo validation; (3) upload re-cut 1.06 market `.ex5`.

## ⚡ AUTOPILOT 2026-06-26 — H9 EXIT-CLUSTER MT5 sweeps PREPPED + internal Debug EA shipped
**Context:** user going to sleep, asked for the #1 MT5 item + autopilot. The #1 item = **H9: re-judge the
EXIT cluster on the MT5 optimizer** (engine exit model untrusted — user found the RR4.0/Trail2.75 lock on
MT5 themselves). Built the runnable deliverables so it's drop-in when they wake. Branch `2-stabilization`.
- **🆕 Internal sweep EA `KK-MasterVP-Debug.mq5` (compiles 0/0).** User's idea: keep the curated/marketplace
  EA exactly as-is (only safe params visible); make a separate Debug/Internal build with **ALL** sweepable
  params exposed. Implemented single-source via a **`KK_IN` macro** in `Inputs.mqh`: normal build `KK_IN`→
  nothing (plain hidden global, **byte-identical**, invisible to the market-edition text transform which
  greps a literal `input`); Debug build `#define KK_DEBUG_EXPOSE_ALL`→`KK_IN`=`input` so every hidden
  strategy/Pm* param shows in the optimizer. 94 globals KK_IN-prefixed; account-lock/expiry NOT exposed.
  **Verified:** curated `KK-MasterVP.ex5` recompiles 0/0, literal `input ` count unchanged 51→51 (market
  surface identical); `make -C cpp_core test` green; Debug EA compiles 0/0 with full surface. NEVER ship Debug.
- **3 optimizer `.set` (in `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP/`, load via Tester→Inputs→Load from `dquants/KK-MasterVP/`):**
  **A** `…-H9-OPT-A-PartialTP.set` (InpTp1ClosePct×InpTp1R, 30 passes, either EA) · **B** `…-H9-OPT-B-BeTrailRr.set`
  (InpBeBufAtr×InpTrailAtrMult×InpRunnerRr, 80, plateau re-confirm) · **C** `…-H9-OPT-C-ProgTrailLadder.set`
  (InpPmProgTrail ON + trigger/increment/step, 36, **Debug EA only** — the "ladder/ratchet" idea).
- **Plan doc `research/mastervp_parity/H9_MT5_OPTIMIZER_PLAN.md`** — exact Strategy-Tester settings (XAUUSD M5,
  every-tick real ticks, 2025.06.01–2026.05.29, dep 10k, rank by **PF not net**), per-grid ranges, pass bar
  (beat PF 1.413, both year sub-folds, then gate.py), run order A→C→B.
- **▶ NEXT (USER, when awake):** run Grid A (then C, then B) on **KK-MasterVP-Debug**, XAUUSD M5. Adopt only a
  candidate that beats the lock on PF+robustness+both folds, then gate it. ⚠️ A **true discrete multi-rung TP
  ladder** (bank 1/3 @1R, @2R, trail rest) is NOT built — prog-trail (C) + partial (A) are the closest levers;
  say the word and I'll build a default-OFF `pm_ladder` (C++ + MQL, golden-parity) + a Grid D.
- **Also still waiting on you (separate, release-blocker):** D1–D3 deployment demo validation (drag
  `TestDeployOps`; run KK-MasterVP `InpGuardEnable=true` on 2 charts) — unblocks the MasterVP release/bump.

## ✅ MQL5 MARKET VALIDATION FIX — MasterVP modify "close to market" (2026-06-26) — re-cut 1.06, NO bump
**Error (validator, EURUSD H1):** `failed modify ... [Modification ... close to market]` — repeated on a
trailing buy. **Cause:** MasterVP `KKMinStopDist` returned `max(stops_level,freeze_level)*pt` with NO
spread term / NO zero-floor; EURUSD on that broker reports both levels **0** → `minDist=0` → the trail's
`okDist` guard let an SL ratcheted to within a fraction of market through → broker rejected.
- **Fix (single choke-point, all 3 modify call-sites route through it):** `MvpSafeModify` in
  `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP/Engine.mqh` now computes `effMin = max(stops,freeze,spread)` floored at
  `10*_Point` and **skips (no-op, retry next tick)** when EITHER current or new SL/TP is within `effMin`
  of market. Mirrors KenKem's proven `SafeModifyPosition`. Layer-4 only → **no engine-parity impact**;
  on XAU the validated trails clear this distance easily → **locked result unchanged**. Compiles 0/0.
- **Re-released 1.06 (no bump, per user):** `./scripts/make_release.sh KK-MasterVP --set-version 1.06`.
  Upload = `releases/1.06/market/KK-MasterVP-Market-1.06.ex5` (internals-hidden market edition).
- **📌 NEW SKILL `/mql5-market-release`** (`.claude/skills/mql5-market-release/`) — error→fix catalog +
  pre-release audit checklist so future validator errors are fixed proactively, not ad-hoc. Memory
  [[mql5-market-validation-skill]]. Invoke on any release OR pasted validator error.
- **▶ NEXT (user):** upload the re-cut market .ex5; if a NEW validator error arrives, run
  `/mql5-market-release` to triage. Uncommitted (Engine.mqh + skill + .set/Changelog) — commit when ready.

## ✅ EXPIRY-LOCK (per-account access end-date) — SHIPPED + RELEASED (2026-06-25) — versions FROZEN at MasterVP 1.06 / Profiler 1.01
**User ask:** extend the marketplace Account-Lock so Master-Volume-Profiler **indicator** + KK-MasterVP EA +
KK-KenKem EA can be licensed to given accounts **until an exact expiry date**; on expiry auto-detect → Alert
**"Expired Access"** + stop calculation. **DONE, end-to-end tested.** Decisions (locked via AskUserQuestion):
per-account dates · **broker server time** (`TimeTradeServer`, fail-OPEN if time unknown — never falsely lock
out) · EAs **stop new trades but keep managing open positions** · separate account list **for the Profiler only**.
- **Shared guard `KK-Common/AccountLock.mqh`** += `KK_ServerNow()` (TimeTradeServer→TimeCurrent fallback),
  `KK_ParseExpiry()` (StringToTime; 0=perpetual/unparseable), `KK_AccessExpired(expiry)` (empty/0 → never
  expire; server-time unknown → fail OPEN). Baked global `ACCESS_EXPIRY=""` added beside `ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_*`.
- **KK-MasterVP EA + KK-KenKem EA:** expiry checked in OnInit + re-checked OnTick → set `g_*AccessExpired`,
  `Alert("Expired Access")` once. **MANAGE-ONLY on expiry** (NOT INIT_FAILED — so a position open across a VPS
  restart is still trailed/closed); entry choke-points gated (MasterVP `OnNewBar` early-return; KenKem
  `EnterOrSkipTrade` → isEntering=false). Both compile **0/0**.
- **Profiler indicator** (`mql5/indicators/KK-MasterVP-Profiler.mq5`): now includes the shared guard +
  baked `ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_*`/`ACCESS_EXPIRY`. Account mismatch → INIT_FAILED; **expiry → stays loaded, clears
  all objects/buffers, `Comment("…Expired Access")`, blocks OnCalculate/OnTimer.** Compiles 0/0.
- **Builder `scripts/make_account_releases.sh`** += `--expiry YYYY.MM.DD` default + **per-line `id, server,
  expiry`** (comma form; whitespace form = perpetual). `norm_expiry()` validates real calendar dates (BSD
  `date -j -f` / GNU fallback) → "YYYY.MM.DD 23:59:59"; invalid date skips that account. Resolves source from
  experts/ OR indicators/ (indicator = display-only, **no marketplace hiding**). Bakes ACCESS_EXPIRY per
  account; ACCOUNTS.md gained an "expires" column. `make account-releases … EXPIRY=YYYY.MM.DD` forwards it.
- **Separate Profiler list:** `scripts/deployment_accounts.KK-MasterVP-Profiler.txt` (gitignored) created;
  `.example` + script header docs updated for the 3-field format. **Source restored byte-identical** (shasum)
  across all lock files in every build path; backward-compatible with existing 2-field / whitespace lists.
- **✅ RELEASED — versions FROZEN: KK-MasterVP EA `1.06`, Profiler `1.01` (user: do NOT bump; re-release at
  same version via `make_release.sh … --set-version 1.06`).** Both carry chart-attach `#property description`
  + `#property link "https://kenkem.biz"` ("For more details, visit …"). Wording fixed — dropped "educational
  only": EA = "Automated trading software - not financial advice and no profit guarantee. Trading carries risk
  of loss"; Profiler = "Analysis tool - not financial advice. Trading carries risk of loss".
- **Per-account builds:** `make account-releases STRATEGY=<name>` → gitignored `releases/<ver>/accounts/`
  (`.ex5` + `ACCOUNTS.md`). **3 client accounts** in the gitignored `deployment_accounts.{KK-MasterVP,
  KK-MasterVP-Profiler}.txt` lists, expiring ~2026.08.26. `norm_expiry()` accepts single-digit month/day.
- **📦 Per-account DELIVERY BUNDLES:** `make account-bundles` (`scripts/make_account_bundles.sh`) → builds
  the locked .ex5 then assembles `mql5/experts/accounts/<id>/` with the EA + Profiler locked .ex5 + all 5
  deploy .set (clean-named) + Profiler .set + README, and a `<id>.zip` per account to send. `--no-build`
  reuses existing .ex5; `--no-zip` skips zips. (Presets/ is a real folder of relative SYMLINKS to canonical
  .set; bundles are real COPIES so they zip/travel.)
- **🔒 Security:** `mql5/**/releases/*/accounts/` AND `mql5/experts/accounts/` gitignored (logins + rebuildable
  artifacts never commit); ALWAYS leak-scan before commit (`git diff --cached -G'<login>'`). ⚠️ Client logins
  still live in OLD pushed history (commit `17189ef`'s `1.05/accounts/ACCOUNTS.md`) — `git filter-repo` scrub
  offered, user has NOT requested it.
- **▶ NEXT (USER):** demo-verify "Expired Access" by baking a past date; ship the account `.ex5` from
  `releases/<ver>/accounts/`. ⚠️ kenkem.biz URL is fine for direct/account-locked distribution; **strip it from
  `#property description` if uploading the PUBLIC build to the MQL5 Market** (`#property link` is allowed there).

## 🛰️ DEPLOYMENT & OPS — D1/D2/D3 BUILT + compile 0/0 (2026-06-25) — ▶ awaiting USER demo validation
**What:** user greenlit "build all D1–D3 in sequence + a drag-drop test EA; can't release/bump MasterVP until
this is validated." DONE. All Layer-4 (live MT5), no C++ analog, default OFF/empty → **KK-MasterVP byte-identical
to the lock** (compiles 0/0; engine + `make test` untouched). New shared headers in `mql5/experts/KK-Common/`.
- **D1 `AccountGuardian.mqh`** — cross-EA prop guardian. Pure math (`KKG_TriggerLoss/DailyBreached/
  OverallBreached/DayKey`, no MT5 API → unit-testable) + stateful `KKAccountGuardian` sharing anchors via
  terminal **GlobalVariables keyed by login** (atomic `GlobalVariableSetOnCondition`+`Flush`). Equity-based,
  **server-time** day boundary, flatten-before-the-line buffer, deal-history cold-start anchor. Inputs
  `InpGuardEnable/DailyLossPct(4)/OverallDDPct(8)/BufferPct(0.5)/DDAnchor/ManualDayAnchor/Flatten`. Wired:
  OnTick Update→flatten+alert-once; entry gate blocks new while halted. ⚠️ Simplified vs full spec (no
  Equity/Balance-at-reset split, day-reset fixed at server-midnight, no DailyLimitBase) — refine per-firm later.
- **D2 `TradeLogger.mqh`** — `InpLiveTradeCsv`; append-on-close `KKTrades_MasterVP_<sym>_<login>.csv`, FileFlush/
  row, live-only, OnDeinit close. Separate from tester-only `InpExportParity`.
- **D3 `Notifier.mqh`** — standalone (NOT KenKem's 5 files), ASCII-only. `InpNotifyChannel{0..7}`+`InpNotifyMode
  {Full,Simplified-prop}`+`InpDiscordWebhookUrl/InpTelegramBotToken/InpTelegramChatId`. Startup + open/close +
  guardian-HALT alerts; tester-guarded.
- **Test EA** `KK-Common-Tests/TestDeployOps.mq5` (drag-drop, like the KenKem Discord validator): runs D1 math
  asserts (PASS/FAIL), sends REAL test msgs per channel, writes sample CSV, self-removes. In MT5 via `dq`
  symlink → `Experts\dq\KK-Common-Tests\TestDeployOps.ex5`. Both EAs compile 0/0.
- **Guide** BOTH MasterVP EA guides updated (English): `KK-MasterVP-EA-User-Guide.md` §5 += Account-Guardian /
  Live-CSV / Notifications + validator-EA step + a **quick-reference table of example values & meanings** for
  every user-facing input (default + example values, illustrative not recommended);
  `KK-MasterVP-EA-MQL5-Marketplace-Description.md` += same features (Simplified-only alerts), example values on
  risk/protection bullets, and fixed stale Broker-GMT-offset → UTC blocked hours.
- **Marketplace force-hide (commit `b80242a`):** new `release.market.forcehide` in `scripts/lib/
  market_edition.sh` strips a key's `input` + hard-codes its value in the **MQL5 Market build only** (dev build
  keeps it configurable, trap-restored byte-identical). KK-MasterVP forces `InpNotifyMode=2` (Simplified) so
  buyers can't resell full SL/TP signals. Validated: market edition compiles 0/0, dev source restored clean.
- **▶ NEXT (USER, live — can't run headless):** (1) drag `TestDeployOps` on a demo chart, paste webhook/token,
  confirm msgs arrive + PASS; (2) demo-run KK-MasterVP `InpGuardEnable=true` on 2 charts (ideally + KenKem) →
  confirm shared anchor/peak + joint flatten. THEN MasterVP release/bump is unblocked. (3) D4 trial-expiry still
  open in BUILD-PLAN. Uncommitted? No — committing this session.

## 🏆 MasterVP XAU M5 FINAL LOCK = RR4.0 / Trail2.75 / BeBuf0.02 — MT5 + DSR PASS (2026-06-25) — ✅ COMMITTED+PUSHED `17189ef`
**Lock: net +87,836 (final bal 97,836) / PF 1.413 / 1,423 tr / maxDD(close-to-close) 21.1%** (XAU M5,
2025.06.01–2026.05.29, $10k every-tick). Both years +PF (2025 1.367 / 2026 1.437). Memory
[[mastervp-runner5-bebuf-lock]]. Run: `research/mastervp_parity/mt5_runs/2026-06-25_xau_m5_RR4_T2.75_confirm/`.
- **DECISIVE = TRAIL fine sweep.** 231-pass MT5 opt (`InpRunnerRr` 3-8/0.25 × `InpTrailAtrMult` 1.5-4.0/0.25)
  → **Trail 2.75 robustly dominates 2.5** (marginal: +12% net, +0.023 PF, -4.3pp DD). Old step-1.0 grid (saw
  only 2.5 vs 3.5) was BLIND to 2.75. At Trail 2.75 the PF sweet-spot shifts to RR~4.0 (study-best PF).
  Sweeps: `…_exit_sweep_RRxBB/` (105) + `…_exit_sweep_RRxTrail/` (231).
- **✅ Beats prior RR5/T2.5 lock on EVERY quality axis:** net +7.8% (83.2k vs 77.2k flat-stream), PF 1.413 vs
  1.389, per-trade SR 0.108 vs 0.103, LESS tail-reliant (top20 74% vs 88%), DD ~tied.
- **❌ REJECTED RR3.2/T2.75** (user ran it first): higher raw net 92k but PF 1.357 + weakening 2026 (1.321) =
  net-max chasing into the low-PF corner. Locked on PF/robustness, not peak net.
- **✅ Gate (deflated n=336):** per-trade SR 0.108, PSR 1.000, MinTRL 198<1423, **DSR 1.000 PASS**.
- **⚠️ MT5 equity-DD ~14.5% is path-dependent KNIFE-EDGE; size ~22-25% (MC 27.7%).**
- **DONE:** `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5.set` + engine `kkmastervp_xau_m5_LOCKED.set` → RR4.0/Trail2.75/BeBuf0.02
  (+ rewritten headers). Inputs.mqh defaults ALREADY 4.0/2.75 (no drift) → EA recompiled 0/0. Temp OPT/CONFIRM
  .set removed. Memory + best-experts table updated. **LESSON (user was right): finer step = anti-overfit.**
- **▶ NEXT (user choice):** lock is committed+pushed (`17189ef`); BRK-POC gate study committed (`e2c6316`,
  REJECTED). Research has CONVERGED — no open MasterVP research lever. Remaining work is **D1–D3 deployment
  infra** (top section, awaiting greenlight) or a release bump `make release STRATEGY=KK-MasterVP` (Y/N, default N).

## 🕐 (history) MasterVP SESSION-TIME migration → pure UTC DONE + MT5-CONFIRMED (2026-06-24, commits `749bb6a`+`7bb9a95`)
**Status:** COMPLETE. Sessions/blocked-hours pure UTC in BOTH engine + EA; user configures session windows
in UTC+0, EA auto-detects broker/VPS offset (`SN_UtcTime`=`TimeTradeServer-TimeGMT`) internally → same UTC
wall-clock on any broker. Day/daily-DD accounting rolls at **UTC 00:00** (the user's clean KenKem model);
force-close-at-session-end toggle (`InpForceCloseSessNews`, default false=lock) correctly gated on UTC
`sessionId==0`. `make test` green, EA compiles 0/0. **Both commits NOT pushed yet.**
- **VALIDATED LOCK is now +59,364 / PF ~1.40 / 1,365 trades** (MT5, XAU M5, 2025.06.01–2026.05.29, 10k).
  The old +62,732 was inflated by the +10 quirk rolling the accounting day at UTC 14:00; pure-UTC rolls at
  UTC 00:00 → 2 extra thin-window losers (2026.02.13 21:55 −1,300; 2026.04.15 20:55 −759) + sizing cascade =
  −3,367. Trading HOURS reproduce exactly (1,363 trades byte-identical; dead-zone 11-13; blocked 4/16/17).
  This −5.4% is the honest cost of true-UTC day accounting; NOT chased (would re-introduce the artifact).
- **Diagnosis trail:** run-1 dropped to +25,292 (windows still on the old +10 frame → active window slid 10h);
  fixed in `7bb9a95` by setting windows to validated true-UTC hours (Asia 21:00-03:00 / Europe[InpLdnSess]
  03:00-11:00 / US[InpNySess] 14:00-21:00) + engine `in_win()` midnight-wrap support.
- **UTC-21 thin-window study → REJECT (keep blocked `4,16,17`).** Exness XAU has a daily break UTC 21-22
  (JST 06-07): only 1,536 bars vs ~4,356 normal. User asked to test blocking it. 6-fold WF
  (`block21_study`): blocking 21 HURTS (PF 1.344→1.303, net 23,098→19,784, dd 7.8→8.7%); +22 ≈ neutral but
  degrades worst-fold (1.223→1.166); +21,22 worse. Baseline 4,16,17 ranks #1 on robustness → no change, no
  gate needed (candidate fails the engine WF outright). The thin-window trades (8/yr @ 21:55) are sparse +
  net-positive in backtest; execution-quality at the break is a live-safety note, not a backtest edge.
- **▶ NO open research action.** Optional: `git push`; update best-experts table XAU-M5 number → +59,364.

### (history) original migration note:
Codex migrated sessions/blocked-hours from the old UTC+10 chart-tz frame (`InpBrokerGMTOffset=10` +
`SN_RefTime`, both removed) to **pure UTC** — in the EA AND the C++ engine. The refactor was correct in
spirit (real-UTC labels: Asia=UTC00) BUT left the locked **blocked-hours string at `2,3,14`**, which in the
old +10 frame meant UTC **{4,16,17}** (the MT5-validated T2 lock: 04 Asian-lunch lull + 16/17 late-London
chop) and now literally meant the WRONG hours UTC {2,3,14}. Proven via entry-hour histogram + clean engine
rebuild (blocked 2,3,14 → PF 1.096/dd 22.6%/5-of-6; corrected → better).
- **USER DECISION: keep real-UTC sessions, make blocked hours UTC-based, re-validate in MT5.**
- **FIXED:** `InpBlockedHoursStr` `2,3,14` → **`4,16,17`** in EA defaults (`Inputs.mqh` + `Inputs.release.mqh`),
  ALL active XAU-M5 `.set` (deploy + A/B + BASE) and the engine sweep set `kkmastervp_xau_m5_LOCKED.set`.
  Sessions kept at real UTC (Asia 00-07 / Ldn 07-13 / NY 13-21). EA compiles 0/0; engine now blocks UTC
  4,16,17 (verified). `releases/*` frozen sets LEFT as `2,3,14` (correct for their bundled old +10 `.ex5`).
  BTC unaffected (was offset 0, blocked empty). Engine WF corrected config: PF 1.145/net 9.9k/dd 17%/6-of-6.
- **⚠️ This is a NEW config** (real-UTC sessions move the no-trade dead-zone UTC 11-13 → 21-23) → NOT the
  byte-identical validated lock. **▶ NEXT (user MT5):** re-run XAU M5 `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5.set`,
  2025.06.01–2026.05.29 every-tick deposit 10k, confirm it's still ≈ the old +62,732/PF 1.40 lock before
  trusting live. Changes are UNCOMMITTED (intermingled with Codex's broader session refactor — review before commit).

## ✅ MasterVP reversion LOCAL-vs-MASTER VP — TESTED → REJECT for lock (2026-06-23, commit e916e34)
Closed the **last open MasterVP research lever** (the user's standing "reversion should fade LOCAL not
MASTER VP" assumption). Built default-OFF `InpRevEntryLocal`/`InpRevTpLocal` (config.hpp+strategy.hpp;
golden parity green, base byte-identical). XAU M3 6-fold WF: **local-fade beats master-fade on every axis**
(net $6,998→$9,280, dd 31.6→22.4%, folds+ 4→5) → **assumption directionally CORRECT.** BUT reversion is
negative-expectancy in all 5 forms (revNet −431..−1,189) and baseline breakout-only beats them all on net
($11,642) AND PF (1.108) → **keep reversion OFF, no lock.** Prior "rev @ mPOC trims DD 17.5→13.5%" master
candidate was survivorship (WF master-form dd 31.6%). Study `research/mastervp_parity/
REVERSION_LOCAL_VP_STUDY_2026-06-23.md`; memory [[reversion-local-vp-assumption]]; build-plan ticked.
**▶ NO open MasterVP research action** — VP-length, FVG-SL, TP1-partial, move-SL, conviction-protect,
flow-exit, local-reversion ALL tested→rejected. The breakout trend-runner is the edge; the deployed locks
stand. Remaining MasterVP items are deploy-time toggles (BTC M5 Ladder) + user MT5/account work below.

## 🔐 PER-ACCOUNT LOCKED BUILDS — shared guard + release script (2026-06-23, THIS SESSION)
**User ask:** a release script that takes a local file of MT5 account IDs (1/line) and builds 1 EA per
account; account-lock is a hidden EA param (empty default); ALL EAs share ONE valid-account-check module;
on mismatch show `Alert("Invalid Account ID")` and stop all EA logic (no detect/execute). **DONE, tested.**
- **Each line = `<AccountID>  <ServerName>`** (user's call, agreed — a login is only unique *within* a
  server). Whitespace- or comma-separated; server optional (omit → lock login on any server); `#` comments.
- **Shared module `mql5/experts/KK-Common/AccountLock.mqh`** — `KK_AccountAuthorized(id, server="")`:
  empty id → true (unlocked); else compares baked pair vs live `ACCOUNT_LOGIN`+`ACCOUNT_SERVER`; on
  mismatch `Alert("Invalid Account ID")` + returns false. Both EAs then `return INIT_FAILED` in OnInit →
  MT5 never ticks the EA (no detection/execution).
- **Wired into BOTH EAs:** KK-KenKem (refactored its old inline Print/INIT_FAILED check to the shared
  module; added `ALLOWED_ACCOUNT_SERVER` in `Config/InputParams.mqh`) + KK-MasterVP (both hidden globals
  in `Inputs.mqh`, include in `Engine.mqh`, guard at top of OnInit). Both globals are plain (NOT `input`)
  → hidden. Both compile **0/0**.
- **⭐ UPDATED 2026-06-25 — account builds now produce the MARKET edition (hide→bake→compile).** Shared
  lib `scripts/lib/market_edition.sh` (sourced by `make_release.sh` AND `make_account_releases.sh`) so
  account-locked `.ex5` are the marketplace (internals-hidden) build, never a full dev EA. MasterVP =
  SINGLE-SOURCE (`Inputs.mqh` hand-curated; `input` keyword = visibility; `Inputs.release.mqh` RETIRED/
  deleted); KenKem = whitelist-strip (`release.market.whitelist`). STANDING RULE: never expose a param/
  comment a user can't understand. (`input` is MT5-only — C++ engine still sweeps every param.)
- **Release script `scripts/make_account_releases.sh <STRATEGY> [--accounts FILE] [--out DIR]`** (or
  `make account-releases STRATEGY=<name>`) — applies market-hiding, bakes each (id,server), compiles,
  emits `releases/<VER>/accounts/<STRATEGY>-<VER>_<id>.ex5` + `ACCOUNTS.md`. **Dev source + dev .ex5
  restored byte-identical** (trap-guarded). **Re-tested end-to-end 2026-06-25: MasterVP + KenKem both
  build clean, source diff empty, no stray backups.**
- **Accounts file (gitignored — holds live numbers):** default `scripts/deployment_accounts.txt`, or
  per-strategy `scripts/deployment_accounts.<STRATEGY>.txt` (auto-detected). Template committed:
  `scripts/deployment_accounts.txt.example`.
- **▶ NEXT (user):** drop real account IDs+servers in `scripts/deployment_accounts.txt` and run per EA.
  Optional: commit decision pending (source changes + script refactor uncommitted).

## ✅ KK-MasterVP PROFIT-LOCK A/B — MT5 VERDICT IN (2026-06-23, commit b1d419d) — DONE
**Result: XAU KEEP BASE (profit-lock OFF); BTC Ladder helps but edge marginal.** 10 MT5 every-tick runs
(2025.06.01–2026.05.29, deposit 10k, parity-export ON, self-contained 101-key .set). Folders:
`research/mastervp_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-23_{xau,btc}_m5_*`.
- **XAU M5 → base wins ALL 7.** A1 base **+62,732 / PF 1.402 / win 54.3%**. Every lever loses: A2 Ladder
  −27%, A3 Floor −46%, C1 Trail2.0 −15%, C2 Trail1.5 −33%, D1 TP1-bank25 −31%, D2 SL1.0 −29% (maxDD 23→33%
  WORSE). XAU is a REAL fat-tail runner (largest win +6,219; 725/740 wins via trailed SL); trail curve MONOTONE
  (2.5>2.0>1.5). **Deployed lock (trail 2.5 / SL 1.2 / TP1=0 / PL OFF) confirmed optimal live — change nothing.**
- **BTC M5 → Ladder is the winner** (opposite direction): B1 base +1,531/1.049/DD28.6% → **B2 Ladder
  +2,311/1.070/DD25.3% (+51% net, −3.3pp DD)**; B3 Floor +2,206/1.053 (helps less, churns 927 trades).
  BTC tail is partly fictional on the noisy Exness feed → locking captures more real profit. Enable
  `InpPmProgTrail=true` on BTC M5 IF deploying — but PF ~1.07 is weak (rev OFF throughout).
- **⚠️ ENGINE WAS WRONG-SIGNED on XAU**: engine WF said Ladder −4.5%, MT5 says −27% — engine under-states the
  cost (over-credits the runner). Reconfirms MT5-is-judge. Memory [[mastervp-profit-lock-ladder]] updated.
- Infra (built, default-OFF, base byte-identical): `ProfitManager.mqh` 1:1 w/ `pm_evaluate`, `InpPm*` inputs
  share engine key names (one .set drives both). Compiles 0/0. Stays in tree — useful for BTC, inert on XAU.
- **▶ NO open action.** XAU done (keep base). BTC Ladder is a deploy-time toggle, not a research task.

## 🏪 KK-KenKem MQL5-MARKET EDITION + GUIDES SHIPPED (2026-06-23)
User: revise the KK-KenKem release to expose only safe knobs (like KK-MasterVP / the original
kenkem marketplace build), hide all secrets; then write internal + marketplace guides. **DONE.**
- **`scripts/make_release.sh` now supports a 2nd hide-internals path (approach B):** a per-EA
  `release.market.whitelist` lists the dialog-visible KEYs; a single type-aware `awk` pass (a) BAKES the
  validated lock's primitive defaults in (`bake_defaults_from:` directive), (b) strips `input` from every
  non-whitelisted param → fixed global (hidden), (c) drops childless `input group`s. Dev source is
  backed up + trap-restored → working tree byte-identical after a release (verified). MasterVP's
  `Inputs.release.mqh` swap (approach A) is untouched. ⚠️ BSD sed can't do `(a|b)` alternation → the
  type filter lives in awk, not sed.
- **`KK-KenKem/release.market.whitelist`** = 21 visible keys: E1/E2 enables, MY_STANDARD_LOT_SIZE +
  COMMON_MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE, E1_RR/E2_RR, daily-DD trio + profit-protection, 3 session/day trade caps,
  news blackout (4) + close-at-session-end, MAX_SPREAD_PIPS, MADE_FOR_PROP_TRADING, showDebug. Everything
  else (ATR/ADX/conviction/Ichimoku/EMA/TF internals, E3/E4/E5) HIDDEN + frozen at D5-E4Long.
- **Released KK-KenKem 1.02** (was 1.01): `releases/1.02/` normal full build + `releases/1.02/market/`
  hidden build (`KK-KenKem-Market-1.02.ex5`, compiles 0/0). Market `.set` filtered to the 21 keys
  (personal + prop). **Upload to MQL5 Market = `releases/1.02/market/KK-KenKem-Market-1.02.ex5`.**
- **Guides:** `docs/guides/KK-KenKem-EA-User-Guide.md` (internal/full, all groups) +
  `KK-KenKem-EA-MQL5-Marketplace-Description.md` (product page, 21-knob, no-financial-advice tone).
- NEXT: await MQL5 Market validation of the new build; if errors arrive, reuse the volume-limit / stops /
  free-margin guard pattern already in BrokerHelpers/entry path.

## 📦 MIXED-PORTFOLIO .SET FILES SHIPPED — MasterVP M5 + KenKem M1, FundedNext Stellar-2 $100K (2026-06-23)
User asked for concrete prop-account presets for the MasterVP+KenKem book. **DONE** in
`mql5/experts/Presets/Mixed-Portfolio/` (+ README): `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5-FN-Stellar2-100k.set`
(attach M5) + `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-FN-Stellar2-100k.set` (attach M1), same $100K account.
- **Both = validated locks with ONLY risk/DD keys changed** (strategy params untouched). Generated by
  copy+override from `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5.set` / `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D5-E4Long.set`.
- **Key mechanic:** BOTH EAs measure DD on the SHARED account equity (MasterVP g_peakEquity/g_dayStart;
  KenKem AccountInfoDouble(ACCOUNT_BALANCE)/peakAccountBalance) → caps act JOINTLY, not additive. So
  both set to the SAME sub-limit below the hard caps (daily 3.5%, account hard-halt 8%).
- **Sizing (the real lever):** MasterVP `InpRiskAccPct 1.0→0.08`%, KenKem `COMMON_MAX_RISK_PER_TRADE
  0.01→0.002`. Chosen so the **UNHALTED** MT5-replay book fits the caps with margin: worst day −2.9%
  (vs 5%), max account DD −7.7% (vs 10%), ~3.1%/mo. Halts (soft-block 5%@0.4, hard 8%) = extra net.
- ⚠️ NOT yet forward-tested on a FundedNext server (Exness-feed backtest). Did NOT run sync_presets.sh
  (would rebuild the Presets tree from EA folders and could clobber the Mixed-Portfolio dir) — files are
  real content in-place. Next: user MT5 demo forward-test on FundedNext before the funded phase.

## 🧬 PORTFOLIO STUDY — MasterVP 3-book (XAU M5 + BTC M5 + BTC M3) on ONE account (2026-06-23)
**User ask:** run MasterVP on BTC M3, BTC M5, XAU M5 at once — maximize joint profit without conflicts.
**Done.** Used MT5-CONFIRMED trade streams (engine exit-model unreliable on BTC), common window
2026-01→05, via the parallel-session `research/portfolio/portfolio.py`. Study + repro:
`research/portfolio/MASTERVP_3BOOK_FINDINGS_2026-06-23.md` + `mastervp_3book_2026-06-23.py`.
- **Only XAU M5 has a validated edge** (PF 1.366). BTC_M5 full-17mo PF **1.013 (breakeven)**; BTC_M3
  PF 1.031 (marginal). Portfolio math can't manufacture profit from breakeven legs.
- **Correlations:** XAU ⊥ BTC ≈ 0 (real diversifier); **BTC_M3 ↔ BTC_M5 = +0.34** → the two BTC TFs are
  partly REDUNDANT, not independent. Risk-normalized to the 4.4% daily cap, **dropping BTC_M3 is better**
  ($4,123 vs $4,073, lower DD); adding BTC at all only beats XAU-alone by ~3% net + more DD.
- **Don't use naive risk-parity/HRP** — they equalize risk and STARVE the only edge (HRP → XAU weight
  0.10, book Sharpe 2.85→1.60). Edge-aware (max-Sharpe/Kelly) keeps XAU ~0.59, zeros BTC_M3.
- **Prop-cap conflict is real:** `InpMaxDailyDDPct=4.4` is PER-INSTANCE → 3 EAs can lose 3×4.4%/day.
  Full-size stack: worstDay −15.2%, maxDD −28.3%, 15 breach-days (vs XAU-alone 8). Budget risk ACROSS
  the book: scale so COMBINED worst-day ≤ 4.4% (XAU ≈0.32–0.34× as-run risk on a shared account).
- **▶ FOLLOW-UP (user: drop BTC M3, combine MasterVP + KenKem):** added KenKem D5-E4Long (XAU M1) MT5
  run. **KenKem is the uncorrelated leg BTC never was — XAU_MVP↔KenKem daily corr = 0.082** despite both
  being XAUUSD (VP-breakout-M5 vs Ichimoku/EMA-M1 fire on different things). Risk-normalized 2-book
  (BTC dropped): risk-parity blend **net $10,349 / maxDD 10.9%** beats XAU-alone $9,939 / 11.8% — a
  genuine free lunch (≈+4% net, LOWER DD). REC = **run XAU M5 MasterVP + KenKem XAU M1, drop both BTC
  legs** (BTC_M5 breakeven). Caveats: KenKem only 126tr (barely cleared gate) → don't over-concentrate
  (risk allocators want 96% KenKem); both XAUUSD+long-trend → size for tail co-movement, not the 0.08.
  Repro `research/portfolio/mastervp_kenkem_book_2026-06-23.py`; study appended to the 3book FINDINGS.
- **Infra:** fixed the 2 RED tests from checkpoint `e8fcb11` (portfolio + cpcv) — BOTH were
  test-expectation bugs, code verified correct. `research/portfolio/ + research/stats/test_cpcv.py` = 18 green.

## 🎯 TP1 + "move SL closer to entry" — VALIDATED (both REJECTED) + a trail win found (2026-06-23)
**Done this session.** Re-ran the user's TWO ideas with the *simple* reading (not the prior agent's
VP "conviction-protect", which WF already killed). Generalized 6-fold WF across all 4 markets
(`wf_mvp_generic.py` + `slice_ticks_by_fold.py`; baselines reproduce prior study exactly). Full writeup:
`research/mastervp_parity/tp1_2026-06-23/FINDINGS.md`.
- **Idea 1 — TP1 partial bank (`InpTp1ClosePct`) → REJECTED.** Banking any % monotonically hurts every
  axis on every market (caps the runner). Re-confirms the 2026-06-20 `InpTp1ClosePct=0` lock, broader basis.
- **Idea 2 — move SL closer to entry → REJECTED (all readings).** BE-ratchet to entry (`InpBeBufAtr 0.0`)
  gives a microscopic pooled bump but **degrades worst-fold** (XAU-M5 1.223→1.175); tighter initial SL
  (`InpSlAtrBrk`) strictly hurts XAU and is **catastrophic on BTC-M5** (PF<1, dd 43–74%). Confirmed on the
  trail-3.5 base too. The edge is a trend runner — pulling the stop IN chops winners; the giveback chart
  was survivorship.
- **🟢 GENUINE WIN (opposite direction): wider runner trail `InpTrailAtrMult` 2.5→3.5 on XAU-M5.** Beats
  the lock on EVERY axis: PF 1.344→**1.472**, net +24%, dd 7.8→**7.4%**, worst-fold 1.223→**1.316**, 6/6
  folds. **Plateau-confirmed** (4.0 corroborates) and **overfitting gate PASS** (DSR 1.000 / PSR 1.000 /
  MinTRL 194<1207, n_trials=28). **Zero parity risk** — `InpTrailAtrMult` is an existing MT5-confirmed EA
  input → `.set`-only, NO recompile. (XAU-M3 trail noisy, BTC-M5 flat, BTC-M3 dead — XAU-M5-specific.)
- **🧨 MT5 A/B RAN → trail 3.5 REJECTED, engine ranking FLIPPED** (`research/mastervp_parity/mt5_runs/
  2026-06-23_xau_m5_trail35_AB/`). Same window/ticks/deposit, only `InpTrailAtrMult` differs: **lock 2.5 =
  +62,732 vs candidate 3.5 = +47,791 (−24%)** — exact OPPOSITE of the engine's +24% "clean win". Trail-3.5
  set deleted. **Lock STAYS trail 2.5.**
- **⚠️ BIG IMPLICATION — engine exit-model is directionally UNRELIABLE (over-credits the trailed runner).**
  The engine rejected BOTH user ideas (TP1-bank "caps runner"; move-SL "cuts runner") for the very runner
  gains it over-credits. Its rejection is NOT trustworthy; MT5's 2.5≫3.5 (tighter protection wins) is
  evidence FOR the user's instinct. **The user's TP1/SL ideas must be judged in MT5, not the engine.**
- **▶ NEXT (user-gated, MT5 A/B — all existing inputs, zero parity risk, vs lock `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5.set`
  +62,732):** built 4 candidates in `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP/` (deployed via sync_presets):
  `-Trail20` (trail 2.0), `-Trail15` (trail 1.5) [downward trail = MORE winner protection, the direction MT5
  just favored]; `-Tp1bank25` (InpTp1ClosePct 25, idea 1); `-SL10` (InpSlAtrBrk 1.0, idea 2). Same XAU M5
  2025.06.01–2026.05.29 every-tick, deposit 10k. Adopt any that beats +62,732.
- ⚠️ Tree note: 2 RED tests committed in `e8fcb11` (portfolio + cpcv, another session's WIP) — not yours; ignore.

## ▶ ACTIVE THREAD 2026-06-23 — KK-MasterVP: float master-mult ✅ + TP1 conviction/giveback ✅ NOT-LOCKED
**Goal:** (1) make `InpMasterMult` a float + sweep at 0.5 steps; (2) revise the no-TP1 policy so a winner
that nearly hits TP doesn't hand back >50% on a retrace — bank a partial WITH CONVICTION (VP near-price
verdict / net delta against the trade), not blindly. Commit `ef7dd1b` (pushed).
1. **✅ FLOAT master-VP multiple SHIPPED.** `master_len = round(vp_lookback × mult)`. Wired C++
   (`Params::master_mult` double, `master_len()` rounds, `D()` parse), EA (`Inputs.mqh`/`Engine.mqh`),
   Profiler. Byte-identical at integer mults (`make test` 37/37 + golden parity). ⚠️ GOTCHA: `make test`
   does NOT rebuild the backtester app — `make backtester` after touching config.hpp or half-steps
   silently truncate via the stale binary. 0.5-step sweep (`vp_length_float_sweep_2026-06-22.py`,
   findings `VP_LENGTH_FLOAT_SWEEP_2026-06-22.md`): XAU-M3 (480b/4.0), BTC-M5 (720b/30), BTC-M3 (dead)
   all CONFIRMED — no float gain. **XAU-M5: float reveals shorter master (mult 3.0–3.5 = 324–378b)
   generalizes better OOS (PF 1.42–1.51, dd ~8% vs lock 4.0's 1.322/12.3%) BUT lock owns TRAIN (1.355)
   → single-window, queued as a per-fold WF candidate, NOT re-locked.**
2. **✅ TP1 PROFIT-PROTECT — BUILT (both default-OFF), FULLY TESTED → NOT LOCKED (NOT ported to EA).**
   (A) **giveback-cap** (blind, `ProfitManager` #3, already engine-wired): lock (1−cap) of peak after
   MFE≥arm. (B) **conviction-protect** (NEW, the user's idea): one-shot partial bank + stop ratchet when
   MFE≥arm AND near-price VP node-net flips against the trade (long net≤−min). New per-bar
   `node_net_close_` array + `PositionManager::conviction_protect()`; keys `InpEnableConvictionProtect/
   ConvictionArmR/NetMin/PartialFrac/LockFrac` + `InpPmGiveback*`. Base byte-identical (golden green).
   Single XAU-M5 split looked great (OOS PF 1.322→1.409) but **6-fold WALK-FORWARD KILLS the lock case:**
   baseline POOLED PF 1.344/net 23,098/dd 7.8%/**worstPF 1.223** is best on worst-fold; EVERY variant
   degrades worstPF (giveback arm2 → net −24%). Best variant conv arm1.0/net0.2 improves pooled net
   +5.7%/dd 7.1% but worstPF→1.192 + 2/6 folds down → **fails "improve pooled AND not degrade worst
   fold"** (the T1 rule). The motivating chart was **survivorship** (same as FVG/VMC). XAU-M3 marginal-
   negative; **BTC-M5 single-split jump (+88% OOS net) is FEED-SUSPECT** ([[mastervp-t3-reversion-lock]]
   BTC partial/reversion wins are MT5-FICTIONAL) → needs a BTC WF harness + MT5 A/B, not chased. Full
   study: `research/mastervp_parity/TP1_CONVICTION_STUDY_2026-06-22.md`. **Verdict: ships as tested
   default-OFF infra; user can toggle on a chart for discretionary peace-of-mind, but it is NOT a
   portfolio improvement and is NOT locked.**
3. **▶ NEXT (recorded, optional):** (a) per-fold WF of XAU-M5 master mult ∈ {3.0,3.5,4.0} (the one float
   lever with OOS signal); (b) build a BTC fold harness to honestly test conv `p0.3 lk0.6` on BTC-M5
   (feed-caveated); (c) the older lever — reversion should fade LOCAL VP not master
   ([[reversion-local-vp-assumption]]). All three are research, not blocked on the user.
_Below: prior MasterVP threads + KenKem (separate)._

## ▶ PRIOR THREAD 2026-06-22 (b) — KK-MasterVP: VP-length re-sweep ✅ + FVG-anchored SL ✅ REJECTED
**Goal:** make sure we're not missing edge on BTC-M3, BTC-M5, XAU-M3, then add the user's FVG-beyond-SL idea.
1. **✅ VP-length re-sweep DONE — no missed edge.** On corrected M1-resampled bars (a stale per-year XAU
   bar file was missing whole trading days — fixed via `cpp_core/tools/resample_m1.py`): XAU-M3 lock 480 &
   BTC-M5 lock 720 both sit on robust train+OOS plateaus with the lowest OOS DD; **BTC-M3 breakout is
   structurally dead at every VP length** (PF 0.75–0.90 both windows). Secondary ADX/break-buf/SL sweep
   confirms all locks on the joint basis (the one OOS spike, XAU SL1.3, degrades TRAIN = curve-fit trap).
   Findings: `research/mastervp_parity/VP_LENGTH_RESWEEP_2026-06-22.md`.
2. **✅ FVG-anchored SL — FULLY TESTED → REJECTED (NOT ported to MQL5).** Engine feature
   `kk::apply_fvg_sl` (`cpp_core/include/kk/mastervp/fvg_sl.hpp`, default OFF, +4 tests, `make test`
   green) re-anchors a breakout stop / gates entry on a significant 3-bar FVG beyond VAL/VAH. Tested
   THREE forms on all targets: (a) **stop-relocation** = inert-to-marginal (where it cuts OOS dd it's
   just a wider stop trading away TRAIN PF — curve-fit trap); (b) **entry-gate `InpFvgRequire`** showed
   a tempting single-split XAU-M3 OOS jump (1.320→1.504) BUT **per-month walk-forward killed it**
   (`_fvg_wf.out`): OFF wins total net by ~$8.6k over 11 folds, the gate guts the best month
   (2026.01 −$6.7k), sign is regime-dependent (worsened 2025.07, reversed on BTC-M5); the "6/11 folds"
   was a PF-ratio artifact on low-net months; (c) **BTC-M3 unrescuable** — no entry edge, FVG only
   bleeds less. Full study: `research/mastervp_parity/FVG_SL_STUDY_2026-06-22.md`. **Verdict: keep all
   locks OFF; feature stays as tested default-OFF infra, NOT ported (WF failed → no gate run needed).**
   The chart "before/after" examples were survivorship — confirms [[vmc-momentum-module-result]] lesson.
3. **▶ NEXT (recorded, not yet tested):** user assumption that mean-reversion should fade LOCAL VP, not
   master (`[[reversion-local-vp-assumption]]`; code currently fades master). Plan in BUILD-PLAN — the
   one remaining open MasterVP research lever after VP-length + FVG both came up empty.
_Below: KenKem thread (separate)._

_Last updated: 2026-06-22 by Claude (Opus 4.8). Branch `reliableBaseline`. **⭐ KenKem LOCK = D5-E4Long** (E1+E2+E4-long; MT5 +1427/PF1.428/126tr; MC-hardened P(profit) 94.9%; gate PSR 0.953/MinTRL 122<126 PASS — the ONLY KenKem config to clear the gate; commit `c5719e8`). **THIS SESSION (2026-06-22, commit `6bca71b`): tested the live E1 frontier = a new Kaufman Efficiency-Ratio (ER) chop filter → WEAK, NOT locked.** New engine keys `E1_ER_PERIOD/E1_ER_MIN/E1_ER_ABANDON` (default OFF = exact base parity, `make test` 28/28, no lookahead, post-gate E1 drop). The E1-only grid plateau (N=5 dominant, +1160/PF1.6) was a LIMITER-CHOKED-REGIME ARTIFACT (83 E1 trades) that does NOT transfer to the free-fire lock book (189 E1): in the FULL D5-E4Long book the ER filter is **pooled-net-NEGATIVE** (3327–3401 vs OFF 3477) for only flat-to-marginal PF; the 2026-OOS gain is real but lives in the **trustworthy E1 book** (by-kind decomp: OOS-E1 +20.9→+127.0, PF 1.02→1.15 at ER_MIN 0.20; E2 flat-positive; E4 swings are FICTIONAL noise) AND is a **narrow small-n spike, NOT a plateau** (gain only at 0.20–0.25, gone at 0.15/0.30, n=21 OOS-E1). Gate: per-trade Sharpe 0.110→0.113 (+2.6%, engine can't distinguish). **Verdict: D5-E4Long STAYS lock; ER committed default-OFF as infra.** `D6-E1ER.set` is **ENGINE-ONLY** (the MQL5 EA does NOT implement ER → loading it just re-runs D5 → NOT a valid MT5 A/B). Findings: `research/optimization/KENKEM-E1-EFFICIENCY-RATIO-2026-06-22.md`. **⛔ AUTOPILOT BOUNDARY REACHED for E1/E2/E4/E5:** every remaining lever is either MT5-gated (E1 MTF-EMA value-diff dump; E5 latch-internal dump) or unsafe-to-parity (E4 intrabar-exit fix touches the SHARED `manage_tick` that holds the validated E1/E2 lock — deliberately untouched). **DECISION POINT for user:** (1) chase the narrow OOS-E1 ER signal? → requires porting ER into the MQL5 EA (default-OFF) then MT5 A/B D5-E4Long vs D6-E1ER — I judged that port NOT worth this thin evidence; (2) or `make release STRATEGY=KK-KenKem` to package the confirmed D5-E4Long lock (left for user sign-off, semi-outward-facing). — Prior thrust context below: **🔴 KenKem CLEAN REWRITE** (see the red KenKem section + `docs/BUILD-PLAN-KENKEM-REWRITE.md`). **GOAL:** kill trash dquants KK-KenKem, rewrite cleanly transcribing **E1+E2+E5 faithfully from the original KenKemExpert MQL5** (`../kenkem`), E4 excluded (MT5 net-loser). Decisions locked: scope=E1+E2+E5, source=KenKemExpert MQL5. **APPROACH PIVOT (this session, with rationale):** the "surgical clean-module rewrite" was abandoned for a **FAITHFUL FULL CLONE** — because Alerts are woven into the trading files (EntryBase/RiskManager/TradeManager/EMAHelpers all call them), so surgically excising them risks the very parity the user demands. Methodology: clone faithfully → **parity by construction** → confirm parity in MT5 (P4) → THEN prune cosmetics with a known-good safety net (a parity failure after pruning is then unambiguously the prune, not a port bug). **P1–P3 DONE + compiling 0/0 (this session):** `mql5/experts/KK-KenKem/` is now a faithful clone of `KenKemExpert.mq5` v1.8.154 — all **31 `.mqh`** (Config/Core/Entries/TradeManagement/Utils/Parity/Alerts/DataCollection) + Data CSV + the `.mq5` (header reset to `#property version "1.0"`, `#define VERSION "KK-KenKem 1.0-dev"`). **Compiles 0 errors / 0 warnings in dquants.** VERIFIED: **all 412 keys** of D3-noE4 / D4 / D4-E5 / D4-E2RR14 `.set` resolve (0 missing); parity export (`Parity/{BarTrace,TradeJournal}.mqh`, inputs `InpExportBarTrace`/`InpExportTradeJournal`) is built in. Excluded subsystems present-but-INERT in tester (NotificationMode=disabled, ENABLE_CSV_EXPORT=false, ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_*=false, WebRequest off in tester, E4 off via `.set`) → zero logic change. **DEPLOYED:** EA visible to MT5 via `Experts\dquants` symlink (`KK-KenKem/KK-KenKem.ex5`); `sync_presets.sh` re-run → candidate `.set` loadable from Tester→Inputs→Load→`dquants/KK-KenKem/`. (Prior `9de0342`: P0 kill old EA + build-plan + `make_release.sh` auto-bump; legacy at `KK-KenKem/releases/1.8.154-legacy/` = match target. The keystone commit `3e94e3c` shell+Inputs is superseded by the clone — its `Inputs.mqh` removed; `Config/InputParams.mqh` is the live one.) **P4 ✅ EXACT PARITY (2026-06-21):** user ran KK-KenKem (XAU M1, 2025.03.02–2026.05.29, D3-noE4.set); collected to `mt5_runs/2026-06-21_D3-noE4_clone/`. Clone trades are **byte-for-byte identical** to the legacy lock log — n=**102**, net=**+1048.88**, PF=**1.389**, wins=53 (sorted-rows `diff` clean). **dquants KK-KenKem == legacy KenKemExpert, trade-for-trade.** Faithful-clone methodology validated. **D4 + LEVER ISOLATION DONE → D4 REJECTED, D3-noE4 STAYS LOCK (2026-06-21):** ran D4 (+1382/1.489 pooled) + D4-ADXonly (+1121/1.407) + D4-TAonly (+1295/1.467). Per-period decomp (`mt5_runs/2026-06-21_D4-LEVER-ISOLATION.md`): **every D4 variant is WORSE out-of-sample (2026)** than D3-noE4 (OOS +326.86/1.475) — all gains are in-sample 2025Q4 curve-fit; ADX23 is the OOS degrader (causes 2026Q2 +56.95→+11.86), touch-age60 milder but still sub-baseline OOS. **OVERFITTING GATE on D3-noE4** (`research/stats/gate.py`, new CLAUDE.md mandate): ⚠️ **WARN/under-powered** — PSR-vs-0 **0.922** (below 0.95 PASS), **MinTRL 136 > 102 trades** (sample too short), DSR n/a (sweep doesn't log `sr_trial_std`). So D3-noE4 is best+exact-parity but NOT statistically confirmable at 95% on 102 trades. **⭐ D5-E4Long = NEW LOCK CANDIDATE, FIRST TO CLEAR THE GATE (2026-06-22):** entry-isolation runs (E4-only, E3-only) showed E4/E3 are net-losers standalone BUT both fail entirely on the SHORT side (E4 longs PF1.40, shorts PF0.555; E3 dead/20tr). Added default-OFF `E4_LONG_ONLY` input (Entry4 short-detect guarded; base stays exact-parity) + compiled headless via `scripts/compile_mql5.sh` (0/0). **GOTCHA:** first D5 run used a STALE cached binary (MT5 was running; external compile doesn't hot-reload) — fixed by MT5 clean-restart (`pkill terminal64` + clear Bases/MQL5 Cache + relaunch); verify the new input appears in the run-log dump. Valid run `mt5_runs/2026-06-22_D5-E4Long/` (E4=25L/0S confirmed): **pooled +1427.17/PF1.428/126tr** (vs lock +1048.88/1.389/102 → +36% net, PF↑), **2026 OOS +497.15/1.523** (vs +326.86/1.475 → better net AND PF), **gate PSR 0.955 PASS (≥0.95), MinTRL 118<126 SUFFICIENT** — the FIRST KenKem config to clear the gate (lock was WARN). 2026Q2 soft (−119) is ALL E4-long lumpiness (4tr, 2 stop-outs); E1+E2 core was +73 there (>lock's +57) → not a regime break. E5 stays OFF (noise). **NEXT:** (a) ⭐ harden D5-E4Long via walk-forward + Monte-Carlo (CLAUDE.md §7) watching E4-long per-fold stability (small n=25), then adopt as lock + `make release STRATEGY=KK-KenKem` + update best-experts table; (b) or lock+release now if user accepts. **D4-E5 DONE → E5 REJECTED (2026-06-21):** ran D4-E5 (XAU M1, every-tick), collected to `mt5_runs/2026-06-21_D4-E5/` (+FINDINGS.md). E5 = 258 trades @ **PF 1.082** (near-breakeven); pooled E1+E2+E5 +2112.32/PF1.258/356 (more net, LOWER PF than D3-noE4's 1.389; OOS PF craters 1.475→1.188). **Gate: E5-alone PSR 0.718 / MinTRL 2095≫258 = NOISE.** The full-stream "PASS" (PSR 0.966, MinTRL 287<356) is a sample-count artifact of pooling noise with signal — per-trade Sharpe FELL 0.138→0.096. **Decision: keep D3-noE4 (E1+E2) lock, E5 stays OFF.** Right way to clear the gate = more E1+E2 history, not E5 dilution. **NEXT (all MT5-gated → user picks):** (a) ⭐ **E4-only** (`KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-E4only.set`) + **E3-only** (`KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-E3only.set`) — user wants standalone E4 & E3 edge isolated (E3 is a full 1193-line counter-trend impl, not a stub; E3 historically "horrible" but user wants to rework it in dquants). Both built from D3-noE4 w/ only that one entry on; same XAU M1 2025.03.02–2026.05.29 every-tick. (b) **D4-E2RR14** refinement. (c) **P5 prune** cosmetics then RE-RUN D3-noE4 → must stay 102/+1048.88 (the `2026-06-21_D3-noE4_clone/` run is the safety net), then `make release STRATEGY=KK-KenKem`. (d) accept D3-noE4 as WARN-status lock + MT5 demo forward-test. **BLOCKED ON USER:** all MT5 runs (I can't run MT5 headless). **FOLLOW-UP:** wire `sr_trial_std` into the KenKem sweep so DSR becomes computable (research/stats README "Still open"). — Prior context still valid: presets organized under `mql5/experts/Presets/` + MT5-symlinked (🗂️ section); MT5 `.set` Load needs flush-left. MasterVP unchanged: **XAU M5 (+60,264/PF 1.40 MT5) is the sole validated front-runner**; BTC M5 reversion FICTIONAL→reverted/not-deployable._

## 📦 PROP-VARIANT RELEASES CUT — KK-KenKem v1.0 + KK-MasterVP v1.01 (2026-06-22)
User: "always release the prop variant (Max daily loss 4.4%, Max account drawdown 9%); release both
KK-KenKem and KK-MasterVP." **DONE.**
- **STANDING RULE (memory [[ea-release-versioning-convention]]):** every release now ships a `*-prop`
  variant encoding firm limits **daily loss 4.4% + account drawdown 9%**. Per-EA override keys:
  MasterVP `InpMaxDailyDDPct=4.4 InpMaxPeakDDPct=9.0` (+`InpRiskAccPct=0.5`); KenKem
  `MAX_DAILY_LOSS_RATIO=0.044 ACCOUNT_DD_RATIO_TO_SOFT_BLOCK=0.09 ACCOUNT_DRAWDOWN_RATIO_TO_SLOWDOWN=0.07`
  (soft-block IS the 9% ceiling — KenKem has no hard-halt input).
- **KK-KenKem v1.0** (first versioned release) — D5-E4Long LOCK. New `release.conf` + dev preset
  `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D5-E4Long.set`; variants `xauusd-m1` (as-swept) + `xauusd-m1-prop`. Compiles 0/0.
- **KK-MasterVP v1.01** (bumped 1.00→1.01) — prop DD caps updated 4.0/8.0 → **4.4/9.0**; 4 variants
  (xau/btc M5 × personal/prop). Compiles 0/0.
- **make_release.sh BUGFIX:** version-scan pipeline died under `set -euo pipefail` when `releases/` held
  only a non-numeric tag (KenKem's `1.8.154-legacy`) — grep exit-1 killed the script. Added `|| true`.
- Both `releases/Changelog.md` auto-updated (MasterVP's auto-created). `.ex5` gitignored; `.set`+RELEASE.md
  +Changelog committed.

## 🟢 KK-MasterVP — MONSTER MERGED IN + EDITION RETIRED + 4-CASE RE-SWEEP (2026-06-22, commit 59cd9dc)
User: "Monster = MasterVP + one impulse delta — bring impulse into MasterVP OFF-by-default without
hurting MasterVP, then kill Monster completely." **DONE + committed/pushed (`59cd9dc`).**
- **Impulse ported into KK-MasterVP, OFF by default (`InpEnableImpulse=false`), byte-identical when OFF**
  by construction (impulse branch never runs; the gate's new `isImpulse=false` param skips ONLY the ATR%
  band for impulse; M1-ATR handle unused). New `MVP_DetectImpulse` (Strategy.mqh, 1:1 w/ cpp
  `kk::detect_impulse`) + `NetVolume.mqh` (`M1NetNear`). EA compiles **0/0**; `make test` ALL PASS
  (golden parity green). C++ side already had impulse in `kk/mastervp` (enable_impulse=false) — unchanged.
- **Monster retired (scope = CODE + BUILD only; research/ + memory KEPT as history, user's choice):**
  rm `KK-MasterVP-Monster` + `KK-Monster` EAs + presets + Presets view; deprecated cpp `kk/monster` fork
  + tools/monster + tests/monster; `monster_*.set` in tools/mastervp; auto-forwards. Makefile + sync_presets.sh
  + run_persist_sweep.sh de-Monstered. Preset tree re-synced.
- **4-CASE RE-SWEEP** (`research/mastervp_parity/resweep_2026-06-22.py` + `RESWEEP_2026-06-22_FINDINGS.md`):
  (A) **all 4 locks reproduce exactly** → consolidation broke nothing. (B) impulse alone is NOT a free
  win on the band-off locks; what it surfaced is that a **VOL CEILING** helps **XAU-M5 (0.158)** (PF
  1.422→1.715, dd 8.1→7.8%, net +10211→+11430) and **BTC-M5 (0.3)** (PF 1.250→1.390) on the OOS window —
  impulse only recovers a sliver of the capped trades. (C) single-window lever upticks are the curve-fit
  trap the WF locks reject. **Nothing locked** — the XAU-M5 ceiling+impulse variant is the one candidate
  worth a full WF+MC+gate pass (BTC-M5 secondary, feed caveat). BTC-M3 still no edge.

## 🧪 RESEARCH-PROCESS UPGRADE — parity-Gate-0 + edge-autopsy + pre-gate signal export (2026-06-21, THIS SESSION)
Closed the "guess-and-sweep with no analytics in the middle" gap the user flagged. Three layers, all
verified, **committed this session**:
- **C++ (enabler, ~40 LOC, ZERO regression):** engine now emits the **pre-gate raw signal stream** —
  `backtester --signals-out <csv>` → every `DetectSignal` (25k) + conditioning features, before gates.
  New `cpp_core/include/kk/common/signal_journal.hpp`; `tick_engine.hpp` collects at the `++raw_signals_`
  site (opt-in `set_collect_signals`); trades **byte-identical** with/without the flag, `make test` all pass.
- **SOP skills (new ordering):** `/quant-0-parity-baseline` (FIRST gate — engine must reproduce an MT5
  run, or N/A→UNVALIDATED if no reference; **never a hard block** per user) → `/quant-6b-edge-autopsy`
  (conditional expectancy/IC/cost-margin/gate-ablation on the raw signals) → `/quant-7-backtest` →
  `/quant-8-sensitivity` (both now say "sweep INSIDE the parity envelope").
- **Notebook `research/mastervp_parity/MasterVP_End_to_End.ipynb`** (29 cells, executes 0-error in
  `kenkem`): full lifecycle words→data→algo→**§0 parity gate**→**§4b edge autopsy**→backtest→sweep→
  WF+MC→§8 candidate re-parity→decision. **Key honest findings:** raw breakout signal HAS edge
  (fwd(20)=+0.135 ATR, t=6.24, net of cost +0.074 ATR); gates RAISE expectancy (0.172 vs 0.133);
  feature IC ≈ 0 (don't tune knobs); **engine↔MT5 = NEAR-MATCH not truth** (XAU M5 best ref: 86% match,
  PF Δ0.9%, net Δ2.4% → strict FAIL) ⇒ engine is a RANKING proxy, re-confirm every lock in MT5.
- Memory: [[engine-pregate-signal-export]], [[parity-is-gate-0]]. **NEXT (optional):** generate an MT5
  XAU M3 BASE run so §0 study-config parity flips N/A→real verdict; extend autopsy to BTC.

## 🧪 RESEARCH-PROCESS UPGRADE — overfitting / multiple-testing gate (2026-06-21, THIS SESSION)
Closed the "swept N configs, locked the best, never deflated for selection bias" gap. New
**strategy-agnostic** layer `research/stats/` (works for KenKem/MasterVP/Monster/BTC via one tool):
- `overfitting.py` — Bailey & López de Prado: Probabilistic Sharpe (PSR), **Deflated Sharpe (DSR)**,
  Min Track Record Length, Probability of Backtest Overfitting (PBO/CSCV), Bonferroni/BH. 8 pytest green.
- `gate.py` — universal CLI: auto-detects `entryTimeUTC`|`ts_ms` + `realizedUsd`|`pnlUsd`, so every
  engine's trades CSV loads through one path. `run_gate()`/`print_gate()` reusable.
- **Wired:** `mastervp_parity/wf_mc.py` (refactored to delegate) + `optimization/robustness_kenkem.py`
  print the gate; `report_metrics.py` gained Sortino/VaR/CVaR; both lifecycle notebooks
  (`MasterVP_End_to_End` §7/§9, ds-study `12_overfitting…` Step 6) show it. `wf_monster.py` = grid-sweep
  → run `gate.py` on its locked CSV directly.
- **Sweep context CLOSED (2026-06-22):** `research/stats/sweep_context.py` wired into ALL FIVE
  `optimize_*.py` — each objective records its trial's per-trade Sharpe, and post-study the harness
  prints `n_trials`+`sr_trial_std`, drops a `<best>.set.sweepctx.json` sidecar, and echoes the exact
  `gate.py` command. No more placeholder dispersion for real sweeps. (Verified: all 5 import clean +
  reporter emits real numbers/sidecar.)
- **Now enforced:** CLAUDE.md non-negotiables + §7 chain + Phase 9/10 skills. **Verdict: DSR ≥ 0.95 = PASS,
  0.90–0.95 = WARN (state it), < 0.90 = FAIL (don't lock).** Memory: [[overfitting-gate-mandatory]].

## 🗂️ PRESETS ARE ORGANIZED + MT5-LINKED (2026-06-21) — how to load any `.set`
All deploy/A-B presets are surfaced, by expert, under **`mql5/experts/Presets/<EXPERT>/`**
(`KK-MasterVP`, `KK-MasterVP-Monster`, `KK-KenKem`). Entries are **symlinks** to the canonical
source (`mql5/experts/<EXPERT>/*.set`; KenKem D3/D4 lock candidates → `research/kenkem_parity/*.set`)
so there is **zero drift** — edit the source, the view follows. This tree is symlinked into MT5:
`MQL5/Profiles/Tester/dquants -> dquants/mql5/experts/Presets`, so in the Strategy Tester →
**Inputs → Load** you open `dquants/<expert>/` and pick the preset directly.
- **Add a new deploy preset:** drop the real `.set` in the EA folder (or `research/kenkem_parity/`
  for KenKem locks), then run **`./scripts/sync_presets.sh`** (idempotent; rebuilds the tree + relinks MT5).
- After a fresh clone, run `sync_presets.sh` once to recreate the MT5 link. See `mql5/experts/Presets/README.md`.
- ⚠️ Old per-run habit of `cp`-ing single `.set` into the flat `MQL5/Presets/` dir is now superseded —
  everything loads from `Profiles/Tester/dquants/`. (The flat `MQL5/Presets/` dir is MT5's separate
  chart-attach mechanism; leave it.) MT5 `.set` Load still needs flush-left `key=val` (no indent).

## 🆕 PER-ENTRY-TYPE TRAIL OVERRIDE — BUILT + verified + presets ready for MT5 (2026-06-21)
User asked: let each entry family override the global `trail_runner` SAFELY, then sweep + ship MT5 sets.
**DONE.** Tri-state per family `trail_brk/rev/imp/xrev` (`InpTrailBrk/Rev/Imp/XRev`): **-1 inherit (default
everywhere → base byte-identical) / 0 fixed-TP no-trail / 1 force trail.** Resolved once per position at open
(cpp `PositionManager` from Signal flags; EA `KKResolveTrail` from `reason`, XREV>IMP>REV>BRK). Lets reversion/XRev
bank a fixed mPOC TP while breakout keeps trailing — the additive deploy that was impossible before.
- **Safety**: `make test` 30 OK (+2 per-type-trail cases) incl. golden parity; XAU M3 base OOS UNCHANGED (PF 1.114/
  net +4575.4/dd 17.5%) with overrides -1. C++ + BOTH EAs compile **0/0**.
- **Additive sweep (OOS):** the one real candidate = **XAU M3 + reversion @ mPOC** (`InpEnableReversion=true,
  InpRevTpMpoc=true, InpTrailRev=0`): PF 1.114→**1.123**, net +4575→**+4888**, **maxDD 17.5→13.5%** (humble bank
  trims DD). XAU M5 / BTC reversion @ mPOC HURT; XRev @ mPOC ≤ trailing (BTC trends → far edge wins).
- **User's MT5 XRev screenshots (2026-06-21):** BTC M3 +XRev net 3070→**3561** (PF 1.09→1.10, DD 14.4→15.7% — "ok");
  XAU M3 +XRev net 10422→**9353** (PF 1.09→1.08, DD↑ — "not great", MT5 disconfirms engine's mild XAU help).
- **▶️ NEW MT5 A/B:** Expert `KK-MasterVP`, XAUUSD **M3**, 2025.06–2026.05, every-tick — preset
  `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M3-RevMpoc.set` vs base `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD.set`. Both copied to MT5 Tester + kenkem Presets.
  Engine: net +4575→+4888, maxDD **17.5→13.5%** — watch whether MT5 confirms the DD trim. Commit: see below.

## 🆕 KK-MasterVP EXTREME REVERSION (XRev) — BUILT, OFF by default, awaiting MT5 A/B (2026-06-20)
Built the `research/hypotheses/strategy-descriptions/KK-MasterVP-ExtremeReversion.md` plan: failed-breakout
liquidity-sweep reversal entry family. **Toggle OFF by default → locked base BYTE-IDENTICAL** (golden test
`test_parity_golden` unchanged + empirical 103/103 trades identical). Full writeup: `research/mastervp_parity/XREV_FINDINGS.md`.
- **C++**: `extreme_reversion.hpp` (pure detector) + `is_extreme_rev` Signal + 13 `xrev_*` params/keys +
  precompute lookbacks & priority dispatch in `tick_engine.hpp` (gated). 9-case golden test green; `make test` 28 OK.
- **MQL5**: `ExtremeReversion.mqh` 1:1 port wired into BOTH `KK-MasterVP/Engine.mqh` and
  `KK-MasterVP-Monster/Engine.mqh`, `InpXRev*` default OFF. Both EAs compile **0/0**.
- **Sweep (isolated + additive, train/OOS; 6-fold WF infeasible — ~1-2 tr/fold, the family is RARE):**
  upper-wick sweep-tail is the strongest discriminator; `BigCandleAtr` must stay ≤0.6 (1.0 overfits → OOS PF 0.54);
  node-net gate is noise. Candidate: Wick0.5/BigCandle0.6/Body0.3/Closes2/Age40/RR2.0/Net0.0/NodeOff/SL0.7.
- **Additive verdict (real overlay):** BTC M3 (Monster, impulse+M1) OOS PF **1.284→1.330**, net +4288→+5138,
  dd **7.1→6.6%** (HELP, +9 tr, dd↓). XAU M3 OOS PF 1.114→1.122 (mild help). XAU M5 1.422→1.401 (HURT — don't enable M5).
- **⚠️ CAVEAT:** the big win (BTC M3) is on the BTC/Exness feed that's historically MT5-OVER-optimistic on
  reversion ([[mastervp-t3-reversion-lock]] revNet eng +5,414 vs MT5 −76). XRev is also reversion on BTC. Sample 9 tr.

## 🎨 KK-MasterVP-Profiler INDICATOR — EA-twin REVERTED → standalone reborn + UX hardening (2026-06-21)
**User killed the EA-twin Phase-A/B build** ("total failure") and asked to restore the **exact standalone
kenkem original**. THIS session = restore + align to EA + fix look/feel. All UNCOMMITTED (working tree also
holds an unrelated KenKem-rewrite session — DO NOT broad-commit; commit ONLY the Profiler `.mq5` + its log).
Indicator compiles **0 errors / 0 warnings** after every change.
- **RESTORED:** `cp` kenkem `MQL5/Indicators/KK-MasterVP-Profiler/KK-MasterVP-Profiler.mq5` (2048-line,
  self-contained, NO shared includes) over the gutted 469-line EA-twin. (The old `Decision.mqh` EA refactor
  from Phase A still exists in `KK-MasterVP/` and is harmless/unused by the indicator now.)
- **VP defaults aligned to the EA** (`KK-MasterVP/Inputs.mqh`): `InpVpLookback` 50→**120**, `InpMasterMult`
  3→**4** (master VP = **480 bars**), `InpVpBins` 40→**30**. POC/VAH/VAL now match the EA.
- **`InpVpAbsoluteM5` (M5-absolute VP window) — BUILT then REMOVED.** User wanted a toggle to interpret
  lookback as M5 bars and scale to chart TF; once told it's only *near*-identical (not bit-exact: bar-feed
  binning granularity differs), user said drop it. Fully reverted from EA + indicator. Don't re-add.
- **Label/UX tweaks (user-requested):** histogram "Net Vol"→**"Net"**; POC/VAH/VAL state tags drop the % delta
  (`mPOC ▲90%`→`mPOC ▲`, `TagText` no longer prints pct); `InpSetShowRejects` default **false** (no more
  `xS chase 7.2ATR` reject labels by default).
- **🩹 BLINKING FIXED (root-caused):** the 480-bar **real-tick** window (`CopyTicksRange` ~24h) intermittently
  fails on BTC M3; `OnTimer` retried every 5s → histogram flipped TICK(fine)↔BAR(chunky) + net%s flipped.
  **Fix = `InpUseRealTicks` default `false`** → structure ALWAYS bar feed (deterministic, EA-exact, OnTimer
  thrash now dormant). User chose this over a sticky-tick option.
- **Resolution 2×:** `InpHistBins` 120→**240** + raised internal clamp **200→600** (the old cap silently
  throttled it). Thinner/finer rows.
- **🔀 HYBRID net-delta (user's idea, BUILT):** structure (background buy/sell rows) = bar feed (stable);
  the **bright net-delta slice + near "Net%"/over/under + bias arrow** = REAL tick-rule signed volume.
  New `ComputeTickDelta()` bins ticks over a **capped recent window** (reliable, unlike full 480) into
  `g_binTBuy/g_binTSell`; `BinDeltaNet(bin)` returns tick-net where covered else bar-net (strict superset).
  New inputs `InpHistTickDelta`=true, `InpHistTickBars`=200. Panel feed tag now `[BAR+tickD]` turquoise /
  `[BAR]` orange / `[TICK]`. CAVEAT: delta is true-tick only within `InpHistTickBars` (recent prices),
  bar-net for the older/upper part of a tall profile.
- **🩹 PANEL OVERFLOW on Retina/scaled Macs FIXED:** top-right table had a hardcoded `w=184` box → text spilled
  the border. `DrawPanel` now builds all rows first, measures the widest with DPI-aware `TextGetSize`
  (`TextSetFont("Consolas",-80)` matches OBJ_LABEL rendering) via new `PanelTextW`/`PanelTextW1`, and sizes
  the box to fit (+12px pad each side). Auto-correct across displays.
- **⏳ NEXT:** user re-attaches the indicator (saved chart inputs override new defaults — must re-add or set
  `InpUseRealTicks=false`/`InpHistBins=240` manually) and eyeballs BTC M3 + a Retina screen. Then commit just
  the Profiler `.mq5` (+compile log). Indicator `CLAUDE.md` still describes the dead EA-twin design — rewrite
  it to the standalone reality before/at commit.

## 🔥 PROFITABILITY UPLIFT — T2 hour-block + T3-EXIT + T3-REVERSION (2026-06-20) ✅ DONE
6-fold WF with PER-FOLD recent-regime decomposition (the T1 discipline). New diag
`research/mastervp_parity/hour_atr_decomp.py` (per-broker-hour net/PF + per-fold split).
- **MasterVP (XAU M5) — WIN, LOCKED `InpBlockedHoursStr=2,3,14`** (ref-tz UTC+10 = block UTC04 Asian-lunch
  lull + UTC16,17 late-London chop; now enforced directly in UTC). Pooled PF 1.243→**1.296**, net +16.6%, maxDD 12.5→**10.0%**, worst-fold
  1.102→**1.196**; 5/6 folds improve, BOTH recent folds rise (F5 +533, F6 +640) → passes recent-regime check.
  MC(20k): P(profit)99.9%, PF 5th-pctile 1.158, maxDD median 22.2%/95th 34.7% (all better than baseline lock).
  REJECTED: news hr0 (net-harmful — post-data hr has continuation winners), Asia hr10 + hr18 (over-block),
  ATR upper-band `InpMaxAtrPct` (non-monotonic curve-fit noise, costs net). `InpBlockedHoursStr` is a REAL EA
  input (fixed UTC) → ships via `.set`, NO recompile. Engine lock + EA preset
  `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5.set` updated + redeployed (kenkem Presets + MT5 Tester Presets). **✅ MT5 CONFIRMED**
  (`mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-20_xau_m5_T2_hourblock`): blocked hours UTC04/16/17 EXACTLY empty in MT5 (block
  ported faithfully in UTC); PF 1.370 engine vs 1.366 MT5 (0.3%), lag 3.2%, 468/535 matched.
  net Δ 9.2% = known feed-noise (strict-gate FAIL only). On this window block lifted PF 1.339→1.370. CLEARED for demo.
- **Monster (BTC M3) — NO CHANGE (re-validated).** T2 was already done in its lock (`8,10,11,16` + best_btc
  cluster sessions + active ATR band 0.158). Top pooled candidate `8,9,10,11,16` (PF→1.231) is ANOTHER T1
  trap: gain carried by 2025 (F1 +787/F2 +247) while recent F5 −372/F6 −321 + dd worse → REJECTED. Keep current.
- **T1 (gate sweep) — DONE earlier:** MasterVP gates tested→reverted to baseline (commit ded3e81); Monster
  gates negative. MT5 parity confirmed faithful. See [[mastervp-m5-gate-sweep-lock]]. 🔑 LESSON (reconfirmed
  twice in T2): decompose per-fold (esp. recent OOS) BEFORE locking — pooled WF avg hides regime shifts.
- **T3-EXIT (XAU M5) — WIN, LOCKED `InpTp1ClosePct` 20→0** (commit 4f45ec3). The Pine 20% partial was
  INHERITED verbatim, never WF-swept (the M5 lock only swept entry/risk). Per-fold sweep
  (`wf_mastervp.py --grid InpTp1ClosePct`) is MONOTONIC (0<10<20<35<50 on PF/net/dd/worst-fold) → banking
  any partial caps the trailed runner. 0%: pooled PF 1.296→**1.335**, net +15.3% (19.3k→22.3k), maxDD
  10.0→**9.2%**, worst-fold 1.196→**1.219**; ALL 6 folds improve incl. both recent. Matches Monster/BTC.
  EA recompiled 0/0; shipped `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5-LOCKED.set` (MT5 Presets). ⏳ needs MT5 re-run.
  LESSON: WF-sweep even pre-tuned "faithful" values. See [[mastervp-tp1-partial-zero-is-best]].
- **⏳ IN FLIGHT: full exit-block joint WF sweep** (`InpTp1ClosePct × InpTp1R × InpTrailAtrMult`, 33 combos
  × 6 folds, `research/mastervp_parity/exit_block_sweep.out`) — the entry side got a joint sweep, the exit
  side never did. Lock the whole exit block the same way once it lands.
- **T3-REVERSION (mean-reversion activation) — DONE, 2 WINS / 2 REJECTS** (`research/mastervp_parity/wf_t3.py`,
  generalized 4-config harness). Reversion fires ONLY in balance (non-trend) regime = complement of breakout
  → additive. Swept enable→retest→body→sl×4 configs, 6-fold WF + MC, per-fold recent-regime discipline:
  - **BTC M5 (KK-MasterVP) — 🧨 MT5-DISCONFIRMED → REVERTED to breakout-only (2026-06-20).** Engine WF
    sweep had claimed a WIN (`InpEnableReversion=true`…, pooled PF 1.217→1.308, net +62%, revNet +5,158).
    **User ran the locked set in MT5 → BAD.** `mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-20_btc_m5_locked_reversion/FINDINGS.md`:
    fair overlap window engine **PF 1.293 / +10,129 / win 59.6%** vs MT5 **PF 1.058 / +1,761 / win 51.2%**;
    engine **revNet +5,414 vs MT5 −76** → the reversion edge is FICTIONAL on the BTC/Exness feed. Only 57%
    of trades match (XAU ~86%); on matched, exits agree 89% but engine over-wins +8 pts (feed round-trips
    intrabar: 45% continuation vs 94% OANDA — already measured). Same shape as Monster BTC M3 (1.178→1.031).
    **ACTION TAKEN:** flipped `InpEnableReversion` true→false in engine set + all 3 EA presets + MT5 Presets.
    **BTC M5 MasterVP = NOT live-deployable** (breakeven live); the 57% entry-match gap must be closed first.
    **XAU M5 is the sole validated front-runner** (same-session MT5: +60,264 / PF 1.400 / 1294 trades).
  - **XAU M5 (KK-MasterVP) — WIN, LOCKED** `InpEnableReversion=true` at DEFAULT rev params (no tuning beat
    them). Measured ON TOP of the T3-EXIT TP1=0 base: pooled PF 1.335→**1.344**, net +3.6%, maxDD 9.2→**7.8%**,
    6/6 folds, worst-fold 1.219→**1.223** (rises), F6 1.49→1.52. revNet small (+48) = mostly dd-smoothing, not
    standalone edge. MC(20k): P(profit) 100%, PF 5th 1.198, 11/12 months & 7/8 folds, full-stream maxDD med 23.3%.
  - **XAU M3 — REJECT** (revNet ~+27 break-even, maxDD 14.2→15.9% worse, worst-fold 0.731→0.674 deepens).
  - **Monster BTC M3 — REJECT** (default rev: folds PF>1 6/6→4/6, F3+F6 go negative, maxDD 10.6→13.8%).
  Both wins: engine locks + EA presets (`KK-MasterVP-{XAUUSD,BTCUSD}-M5.set`) updated + redeployed (kenkem
  Presets + MT5 Tester Presets). All rev keys are REAL EA inputs → ship via `.set`, NO recompile. ⏳ needs MT5 re-run.

## 📚 ds-study learning track — RELIABILITY HALF ADDED (NB 11 + 12, additive)
Added two notebooks teaching the half that made MasterVP *reliable* (00→10 only taught finding an edge).
**NB 11 `parity_ground_truth`** — ground-truth ladder, diff-config-before-logic (real `.set` diff),
Wilder-vs-SMA ATR bug reproduced on real M1 bars (6.9% mean / 23% bucket flip), trade-level PASS/FAIL
matcher (real `_locked_oos.csv`). **NB 12 `overfitting_and_drawdown_honesty`** — peak-vs-plateau,
walk-forward (11/12 months PF>1) + Monte-Carlo (P(profit) 99.6%, PF 5th 1.10) on real `_wf_fullrun.csv`,
drawdown honesty (calmest 4mo 13.9% vs full-year 27.7% vs MC95th 38.7%). Both executed 0-errors against
real artifacts; README/GLOSSARY updated additively; generator `ds-study/scratch/_gen_nb11_12.py`. Nothing deleted.

## 🟢 KK-MasterVP — TRADE-LEVEL PARITY VERIFIER SHIPPED (production gate, commit 5fc34c9)
**User ask:** make perfect MQL EA editions from the C++ pipeline for production; chose the
**MasterVP parity verifier** track + deploy via **MT5 demo forward-test first**.
- **Gap found & closed:** the shipped KK-MasterVP EA had NO trade-export, so "compiles" could
  never be upgraded to "proven-faithful." Added `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP/Parity.mqh` — a
  trade-level journal byte-compatible with the C++ `kk::to_trades_csv` ledger (21 cols, matched
  rounding), gated by **`InpExportParity`** (default OFF). Wired into `Engine.mqh` (init/close,
  fill-capture, per-tick MFE/MAE, `OnTradeTransaction` → realized P&L across TP1 partial+final,
  TP/SL-WIN/SL-LOSS/EA tags). Compiles **0/0**.
- **Chain proven:** engine-vs-engine smoke (108 trades, May-2026 XAU M5) → `parity_diff.py` **PASS**.
- **Procedure documented:** `research/mastervp_parity/PARITY_WORKFLOW.md` (3 steps: MT5 tester with
  `InpExportParity=true` → C++ backtester same window/set → `parity_diff.py` PASS/FAIL).
- **✅ FIRST PARITY RUN → FAIL → ROOT-CAUSED → EA FIXED** (`research/mastervp_parity/mt5_runs/
  RUN_2026-06-20_xau_m5_parity/`). XAU M5, 2026.01-06: EA 631 vs engine 563, 416 matched, entries
  FAITHFUL (entryΔ≈0), SL formula identical.
  - **ROOT CAUSE = EA runner-TP PORT BUG (not spread).** Exit-tag decomp: MT5 **170 TP** / 175 SL-WIN /
    286 SL-LOSS vs engine **10 TP** / 313 SL-WIN / 239 SL-LOSS. EA capped broker TP at `sig.tp2`=1.8R;
    engine uses 10R runner backstop + chandelier trail (`position_manager.hpp:93-97`, trail_runner=true,
    enable_struct_tp=false, runner_rr=10). **FIXED `Engine.mqh:226`:** TP=`sig.entry±sig.risk·InpRunnerRr`
    when InpTrailRunner. EA recompiles **0/0**. Memory [[mastervp-feed-spread-10x-mismatch]].
  - **SPREAD = real but MINOR:** engine feed 18.9pts vs live Exness 189pts (10×), but `--extra-spread 0.170`
    moved PF only 1.31→1.28 (~$2/trade). Added `--extra-spread` to backtester (`tick_engine::set_extra_spread`,
    golden tests green) for live-cost stress. (My first "spread=root cause" call was WRONG — corrected.)
  - ATR-mode hypothesis tested + DISCONFIRMED.
- **✅ TP FIX CONFIRMED — NEAR-PARITY** (`RUN_2026-06-20_xau_m5_parity_v2_tpfix/`). MT5 re-run after the
  fix: trades 631→**561** (engine 563), TP exits 170→**7** (engine 10), exit-mismatch 141→**39**, matched
  416→**483**, net Δ **409%→2.42%**, PF **1.304 vs engine 1.316**. The runner-TP port bug WAS the parity
  gap. `parity_diff.py` still says FAIL only because net Δ 2.42% > strict 1.0% gate — but that residual is
  **feed-level noise** (bar/ATR value diffs + spread on ~80 boundary trades + 39 exit flips), NOT a logic
  bug. Signal/entry/exit mechanics are faithfully reproduced.
- **▶️ NEXT ACTIONS:**
  1. **Demo forward-test** — the EA now demonstrably reproduces the validated engine; XAU M5 is cleared.
  2. Stress the lock for live PF: `--extra-spread 0.17` (engine PF holds ~1.28 at real Exness cost).
  3. Replicate the runner-TP fix + add `Parity.mqh` into **KK-MasterVP-Monster**, then parity-run it.
  4. (optional) decide whether ~2-3% feed noise is the accepted parity floor for this pair.
  KenKem still NOT production-eligible (E5 parity open).

## 🟣 KK-MasterVP-Monster (BTC) — WALK-FORWARD RE-LOCK this session (robustness ↑, EA re-shipped)
**User ask (this session):** autopilot the walk-forward / multi-fold robustness path I proposed last
time (instead of more single-split sweeping), then auto-produce the MQL EA. **DONE — committed/pushed.**
- **WHY WF:** the prior audit left the inherited secondary params at spec defaults to avoid curve-fitting
  one OOS window. The rigorous test (SOP `/quant-9-walkforward`) is **6 disjoint folds** (2 in the 2025
  train ticks, 4 in the 2026 OOS ticks), adopting a change only if robust ACROSS folds (improves pooled
  result AND the worst fold). Harness `research/monster_parity/wf_monster.py` + engine `--trade-to-ms`
  fold cap (the latter committed by the parallel MasterVP agent — already in HEAD).
- **RESULT — 3 secondary params re-tuned, the rest CONFIRMED at defaults:**
  - Re-locked: `InpDiSpreadMin` 6→4, `InpImpulseTrendSlopeBars` 10→6 (dominant lever, impNet +45%),
    `InpTp1ClosePct` 15→0 (no TP1 bank; BE-after-TP1 still de-risks at 1R). They **stack constructively**
    (tested jointly — repo's "sequential wins can fail jointly" guard): convert the two losing 2026 folds
    to positive → **6/6 folds PF>1, worst-fold PF 1.001** (was 0.867), pooled PF 1.106→**1.140**, dd
    16.0→**13.7%**. On the ORIGINAL single split: **OOS PF 1.131→1.192** (now clears the ≥1.15 deploy
    gate), OOS net +1,956→**+3,014**, OOS dd 10.1→**9.5%**, train also up (1.071→1.084).
  - CONFIRMED inherited-correct by WF: EMA 24/194 (outright best), ema_sep 0.25, node touch 0.05 + gate
    ON, impulse entry_buf 0.4 (flat/inert). REJECTED: impulse max_dist 3.0 (worsens worst fold). Daily-DD
    limiters structurally INERT (6/8/10 identical) — kept 6% as live-safety floor. Full table in
    `research/monster_parity/MONSTER_M3_FINDINGS.md` (WALK-FORWARD section).
- **EA RE-SHIPPED** `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP-Monster/` recompiles **0/0**; the 3 params updated in
  `Inputs.mqh` defaults + all 4 presets (EA folder + `kenkem/MQL5/Presets/`, impulse + NoImpulse). M1-net
  via iVolume=tick_volume. **MANUAL MT5 FORWARD-TEST is the next action.** `InpEnableImpulse` toggles A/B.
- **M5:** still NOT robust on BTC (prior session) — Monster ships **M3 only**.

## 🟠 KK-MasterVP-Monster (BTC M3) — EA fixed + parity-ready + spread-stressed (this session)
- **EA FIXED:** ported the runner-TP fix (`Engine.mqh`: TP=`sig.entry±sig.risk·InpRunnerRr`=5.3R when
  InpTrailRunner, mirrors monster_engine.hpp:275-287; was capped at sig.tp2=3.0R) + added trade-level
  `Parity.mqh` (InpExportParity). Compiles **0/0**. Engine lock reproduces OOS PF 1.192.
- **SPREAD-FRAGILE:** OOS PF 1.192→1.172(+1)→1.157(+2.5)→**1.121(+5)**. Thinner than XAU M5. Cost-aware
  SL re-tune found NO robust improvement (wider SL curve-fits train, degrades OOS). Lock SL=3.7 is the
  OOS-optimum. `research/monster_parity/MONSTER_SPREAD_ROBUSTNESS.md`.
- **✅ PARITY RUN DONE** (`research/monster_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-20_btc_m3_parity/`). BTC M3,
  2026.01-06. TP fix CONFIRMED (MT5 TP=3, exit dist 154/3/148/115 ≈ engine 159/3/144/99). Entries faithful.
  **BTC spread ~$11 ≈ engine feed — NO 10× inflation (unlike XAU);** engine PF was already realistic-cost.
  **BUT net Δ 498%: engine +2,801/PF 1.178 vs MT5 +469/PF 1.031.** Matched 345 agree; gap = unmatched
  (75 MT5-only / 59 engine-only) → EA takes ~75 trades the engine doesn't near session boundaries.
  **→ Monster is MARGINAL live (PF ~1.03), NOT clearly deployable.** XAU M5 is the strong candidate.
- **▶️ NEXT for Monster (only if pursuing it):** diagnose the 75 MT5-only entries — compare entry-gate /
  MaxTradesPerSession / cooldown counting between EA & engine near session/force-close boundaries.
  Otherwise deprioritize vs the XAU M5 forward-test.

## 🔀 ACTIVE THRUST (2026-06-20): KK-MasterVP Pine-faithful rebuild → param sweep → EA
**User pivoted** from KenKem E1–E5 parity to optimizing **KK-MasterVP on XAUUSD M3**. KenKem state
preserved below (📌 PAUSED) — not abandoned.

- **Goal:** reproduce the profitable TradingView Pine (`research/mastervp_parity/KK-MasterVP.pine`,
  PF 1.24 / 5,204 trades / +2583%/yr OANDA XAU) in the C++ engine, then *add missing risk management*
  (daily-DD, consec-loss, anti-chase, ATR-pctile gate, trail/stall exit) via disciplined param sweeps,
  then port to an MQL5 EA for the user's manual MT5 forward test.
- **User chose:** Fresh **Pine-faithful** build · **XAUUSD M3** first · objective **Robust PF + plateau**.
- **User directive (autopilot):** "go autopilot until the C++ engine is super faithful, nothing left to
  sweep while I sleep, then produce the MQL EA for manual testing."
- **✅ S0 DONE (commit a087b52, pushed):** engine aligned to ref Pine via `tools/mastervp/pine_faithful_xau.set`
  + `backtester --set-all` (applies ALL keys incl. MQL non-inputs). Built `research/mastervp_parity/diff_tv.py`
  (regroups TV TP1+TP2 portions → positions; distributional compare). **Entry model is FAITHFUL:** over
  2025-06-19..2026-05-29, engine 2610 positions vs TV 2445 (1.07×), win 56.4 vs 57.8%, hours aligned, TP1-rate
  aligned, %long ±4. **Two fixes found:** (a) the old offset-based session model was a dead path; sessions are now
  evaluated directly in UTC. (b) added `min_atr_ticks` floor (Pine=40), default 0/off so golden test intact.
- **🔑 KEY FINDING — residual PF gap is FEED-DRIVEN, not a bug:** baseline PF 1.01 vs TV 1.25 at MATCHING win
  rate. BE on/off experiment proved it: on OANDA a break that reaches 0.8R continues to 1.8R **94%** of the
  time; on our **MT5/Exness feed only ~45%** (it round-trips). So the TV edge leans on OANDA's smooth
  post-breakout continuation — the edge must be REBUILT for the real feed via exit/risk sweeps. This is the point.
- **✅ SWEEPS DONE + EA SHIPPED (this session) — autopilot endpoint reached:**
  - **S1 entry:** break_buf 0.7 / adx 22 / di 8 best. **S4 exit:** chandelier trail beats fixed-TP2,
    `trail_atr_mult=2.0 + sl_atr_brk=1.0`. **S6b risk:** daily-DD **10%** (plateau 8/10/12),
    loss-streak limiter HURTS (off), risk **1.0%** (lowest-DD plateau). **Q1 (ATR-pctile gate):** inert on
    MasterVP — keep off. **Q2 (anti-chase break_max_atr):** capping HURTS on this feed (2 ATR → negative) — off.
  - **⭐ S8/S8b VP-length (user-requested):** train peak **85×4 (PF 1.271) COLLAPSES to break-even OOS** (curve-fit);
    long-window generalizes. **LOCKED master VP = 480 bars (24h M3) = `InpVpLookback=120 × InpMasterMult=4`.**
    **TRAIN PF 1.264 / OOS PF 1.114, OOS net +4,575, OOS maxDD 17.5%.** Sits interior to a broad OOS plateau
    (480→720 bars all OOS PF 1.11–1.15; <360 collapses, >720 falls off).
  - **⭐ DISCOVERY: local VP is INERT in breakout-only mode** — breakout keys off the MASTER VP's VAH/VAL only;
    local VP is consumed only by reversion (off). Master length is the sole driver. See
    `research/mastervp_parity/VP_LENGTH_STUDY.md`. → user's multi-TF VP idea is a real *future* enrichment
    (turn the dead local/HTF-M5/M15 VP into a breakout AGREEMENT gate; build in C++ + sweep + OOS first).
  - **Locked config:** `cpp_core/tools/mastervp/kkmastervp_xau_m3_LOCKED.set`. OOS validator: `/tmp/vp_oos.py` pattern.
- **✅ MQL5 EA SHIPPED (compiles 0/0):** `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP/` — `Engine.mqh` now ports the FULL C++ safety
  gate stack (quality→session→ATR-ticks floor→spread→max-trades→daily-DD predictive→blocked-hour→peak-DD→
  cooldown→news) + RiskManager (daily-DD 10% + 12h cooldown) + broker-UTC auto-detect (sessions trade the same
  wall-clock hours on ANY broker). Fixed the old EA's hardcoded MTF/RSI veto → now flag-gated (Pine has neither).
  `SessionNews.mqh` = self-contained Sessions (filters.hpp port) + NewsFilter (CSV+embedded calendar) for the
  user's KenKem-style session config + news avoidance (default OFF; live-only overlay, not in backtest PF).
  Preset `KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD.set` shipped to EA folder + `../kenkem/MQL5/Presets/`. **READY FOR MANUAL MT5 TEST.**
- **✅ M5 DEDICATED SWEEP DONE (this session) — M5 BEATS M3 on every axis:** master-len → entry → exit →
  risk, each train→OOS, plateau-picked (`research/mastervp_parity/M5_SWEEP_FINDINGS.md`). Inertness
  re-confirmed (master bars = sole driver). **Locked M5: master 432 bars (36h) = 108×4 · break_buf 0.85 ·
  sl_atr_brk 1.2 · trail 2.5** (rest = M3 lock). Caught the trail overfit-trap (train loves 4.0, OOS peaks
  2.0–2.5). Daily-DD inert on M5 (kept 10% as live net). Result: **OOS PF 1.327 / dd 10.3% / win 58.6% /
  net 7,886 / n 442** vs M3 lock OOS PF 1.114 / dd 17.5%, AND more tail-robust (M5 top-10 = 121% of net vs
  M3 208%). Engine lock `cpp_core/tools/mastervp/kkmastervp_xau_m5_LOCKED.set`; EA preset
  `mql5/experts/KK-MasterVP/KK-MasterVP-XAUUSD-M5.set` (+ kenkem Presets) — attach EA to an **M5** chart.
- **✅ BTCUSD SWEEP DONE (this session, NO-SESSION 24/7, M3+M5):** `research/mastervp_parity/BTC_SWEEP_FINDINGS.md`.
  **M3 BTC = NO edge** (train tunes to PF 1.13 but every config collapses OOS PF 0.72–0.83, dd 57–75% — overfit;
  train/OOS anti-correlated; NOT shipped). **M5 BTC = modest plateau-robust edge** at a LONG master: master
  **720 bars (60h) = VpLookback24×MasterMult30 · adx30 · break_buf1.0 · sl2.2 · trail6.0**, 24/7 sessions.
  Positive on BOTH train+OOS across a 4-D plateau (master×adx×sl×trail): **TRAIN PF 1.155/dd13.9% · OOS PF
  1.214/dd14.2%/win57.4/net+4,228**. ⚠️ tail-skewed (OOS top10=219% of net — lower-conviction than XAU; the
  trend-breakout fat-tail shape). Lock `cpp_core/tools/mastervp/kkmastervp_btc_m5_LOCKED.set`; EA preset
  `KK-MasterVP-BTCUSD-M5.set` (+ kenkem Presets, attach to BTCUSD M5 chart). `sweep.py` now has `--symbol btc`;

- **✅ WF + MONTE-CARLO HARDENING DONE (this session) — XAU M5 lock CLEARED for forward-test:**
  `research/mastervp_parity/WF_MC_FINDINGS.md`. Added C++ `--trade-to-ms` fold cap (`tick_engine
  ::set_trade_to_ms`; golden tests green) + `wf_mc.py` (stability+MC) + `wf_reopt.py` (anchored re-opt) +
  continuous tick file `ticks_xau_full.csv` (gitignored). Canonical continuous stream (1,413 trades over
  2025-06→2026-05, x4.11/+311%, PF 1.260): **walk-forward 11/12 months & 7/8 equal folds PF>1** (only
  Aug-2025 negative, trendless chop); **anchored re-opt 4/5 OOS folds PF>1, WF-eff ~1.0**, and the FIXED
  432b lock BEATS per-fold re-optimization (5/5 vs 4/5) → **not a curve-fit, no periodic re-tuning needed.**
  **Monte-Carlo (20k):** P(profit) 99.6%, PF 5th-pctile 1.108, risk-of-ruin ≤50%=0.06% at 1%/trade.
  ⚠️ **DRAWDOWN HONESTY:** the headline OOS dd 10.3% was a benign 4-month window — true full-year maxDD
  **27.7%** (MC 95th ~38%, worst ~55%); size for **~30-40% peak**, not 10%. **No param change**; EA preset

- **▶️ NEXT (when user returns):** manual MT5 forward-test — XAU **M5 preset is the validated front-runner**
  (XAU M3 A/B; BTCUSD-M5 candidate but lower-conviction/tail-skewed). Remaining optional research: same
  WF+MC pass on the M3/BTC locks, and the local/HTF-VP breakout-agreement gate. Note: EA news/session
  overlays diverge intentionally from the backtest (live-safety), so forward results may be fewer than OOS PF.

## 🟢 KenKem E1/E2/E4/E5 — HONEST SWEEP DONE + MT5-READY CANDIDATES (2026-06-21, THIS SESSION)
User: "focus E1/E2/E5/E4; find issues in trash KK-KenKem; rewrite + sweep best combos (RR/ATR/ADX);
I'll MT5-test after. Do NOT mislead me with C++ results again." **Delivered the SWEEP (testable now)
+ made the EA rewrite execution-ready; did NOT ship unvalidated EA logic (that's the next focused pass).**
- **Engine re-verified as a trustworthy measuring stick:** reproduces every documented baseline EXACTLY
  (E1E2E4 +2101, D3-noE4 +1247, D4 +1695/PF1.419, D4+E5 +2092). `make test` 28 OK.
- **Trust boundary (from prior parity work, applied throughout):** E1 entry+exit = trustworthy; E2 entry
  trustworthy / exit mildly optimistic; **E4 exits FICTIONAL (MT5: net loser)**; **E5 ~53% recall + exit
  optimism**. So E4/E5 net/PF are MT5-gated; only E1+E2 engine numbers translate.
- **E4 exit bug NOT fixed (deliberate):** `manage_tick` is shared with the VALIDATED E1/E2 parity; rewriting
  it risks regressing +1247/+1695. E4 verdict stays MT5's. (Task documented.)
- **Sweep (RR/ATR/ADX × individual/combined), full writeup `research/optimization/KENKEM-E1E2E4E5-SWEEP-2026-06-21.md`:**
  confirms the lock is robust at plateau — **no hidden magic combo**. DYN_RR off = the one robust RR lever;
  E1cap3.5 / ATRpct70 / sideways45 / ADX23 / E2-touch60 = the D4 levers. ⚠️ the E4 fiction even flips the
  ADX-gate sign (helps the clean E1+E2 book, craters the E4-contaminated book) → run sweeps E4-OFF.
- **CANDIDATES (flush-left, load into legacy KenKemExpert.ex5; in `research/kenkem_parity/`):**
  `D3-noE4` (✅MT5-CONFIRMED +1049/PF1.39), `D4` (🟡engine-best E1+E2 +1695, entry-side→MT5-confirm),
  `D4-E5` (🔴engine flips 26Q2 −427; MT5 decides), `D4-E4` (🔴engine flips 26Q2 −115 + exits fiction; MT5
  decides), **`D4-E2RR14`** (🟡D4+E2_RR1.4, +1775/PF1.44 — the ONE refinement that survived `d5` joint
  per-quarter testing; cross-age60/E1cap3.0 were base-dependent illusions, D5-all3 flipped 26Q2 −33).
  **4 exact MT5 run asks in the findings doc** (run #1=D4 first; #4=D4-E2RR14 follow-up). Sweep COMPLETE
  (all 9 families in `research/optimization/sweep_logs_2026-06-21/`).
- **EA rewrite = execution-ready, not started:** open question RESOLVED (live path = OOP Entry1/2/4/5
  `Detect()` via `DetectNewEntry`, first-match E1→E2→E3→E4→E5); verbatim input map + lock defaults + module
  order captured in `docs/BUILD-PLAN-KENKEM-REWRITE.md` "Execution-ready facts". Next pass = P1→P6 transcription.

## 🔴 KenKem — CLEAN REWRITE IS THE ACTIVE THRUST (2026-06-21) — read `docs/BUILD-PLAN-KENKEM-REWRITE.md`
**User directive:** the dquants `KK-KenKem` MQL5 EA was TRASH (no profit); the profitable EA the user
runs is the original **KenKemExpert** (`../kenkem`). Everything now lives in dquants; `../kenkem` is
reference only. **Mission: kill KK-KenKem, rewrite it CLEANLY transcribing E1+E2+E5 FAITHFULLY from
KenKemExpert's own MQL5** (NOT the C++ engine — it has E4-exit fiction + E5 ~53% recall). E4 excluded
(MT5 net-loser). Decisions locked: scope=**E1+E2+E5**, source=**KenKemExpert MQL5**. Memory
[[kenkem-clean-rewrite-from-mql-2026-06-21]]. **P0 DONE** (old EA git-rm'd; phased plan written).
Keystone trick: transcribe KenKemExpert input NAMES verbatim → existing `D3-noE4.set` loads directly →
parity = same-`.set` MT5 diff vs `mt5_runs/2026-06-20_D3-noE4/` (+1049/PF1.39/102tr). **NEXT = P1
foundation** (Inputs subset + State + Indicators + Snapshot, compile 0/0). The optimization notes below
(D3-noE4 lock, D4/E5 candidates) remain valid as the param/parity ground truth FOR the rewrite.

## 🟢 KenKem XAU M1 — OPTIMIZATION: D3-noE4 LOCKED (MT5-confirmed) → D4 candidate awaiting MT5 (2026-06-20)
Pivoted parity→profit. Harness `research/optimization/sweep_kenkem_opt.py` (TICK engine; line-mutates a
base `.set`; reports ALL + 2025/2026-OOS + per-quarter; families: `combos sl tp gates cand wf reorder
e1e2 e1e2b`). Data = XAU 2025-03→2026-05 (15mo). Full writeup w/ all evidence:
**`research/optimization/KENKEM-D3-OPT-FINDINGS.md`** (read the top ⚠️ block first).

**⚠️ MAJOR THIS SESSION — engine D3 was INFLATED by an E4 EXIT BUG (MT5 confirm overturned it):**
- Two `.set` runs were silently ignored by MT5 because the preset had **leading whitespace** on every
  line — **MT5's Tester→Load only accepts flush-left `key=value`** (engine parser tolerates indent). FIXED
  (strip WS, re-sync Presets). *Lesson: every KenKem `.set` we ship MUST be flush-left; verify with
  `grep -cE '^[[:space:]]+'` = 0.*
- Real MT5 D3 = **+905 / PF 1.22 / 155 tr** vs engine +2194/PF1.40. Time-aligned diff
  (`research/kenkem_parity/mt5_runs/2026-06-20_D3/`): ENTRY parity FINE (141/155 matched, over/under-fire
  net ~0); **E1 exit-CLEAN** (eng +883 vs MT5 +868); **E4 EXITS BROKEN** — 48/48 matched E4 have IDENTICAL
  entry time+price but engine books +747 vs MT5 **−42** (engine TP where MT5 hits SL; SL levels differ only
  ~0.29 → engine MISSES the intrabar adverse path; engine `maeR` is a 0.00 stub). E2 mildly optimistic.
- ⇒ engine "E4 is best (PF1.51)" + the reorder-rejection rationale are ARTIFACTS. **In MT5, E4 is a net
  LOSER.** Engine sweep numbers carry exit-optimism bias: worst E4, mild E2, ~none E1 (entry-side trustworthy).

**✅ LOCK = D3-noE4 (E4 OFF), `research/kenkem_parity/KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D4...` → `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D3-noE4.set`.**
MT5 A/B confirmed: **+1049 / PF 1.39 / 102 tr** (`mt5_runs/2026-06-20_D3-noE4/`) vs full-D3 +905/PF1.22;
OOS 2026 +243/1.23→**+327/1.47**; profitable quarters 3/6→**4/6** (25Q2 +231, 26Q2 flips −279→+57; only
26Q1 liked E4, outweighed). D3 keys: `USE_DYNAMIC_RR_SCALING=false`, `E1_ATR_SL_CAP_MULTIPLIER=3.5`,
`SIDEWAYS_BLOCK_THRESHOLD=45`, `MIN_ENTRY_ATR_PERCENTILE=70`, **+ `ENABLE_E4_ENTRIES=false`**.

**🆕 D4 CANDIDATE (engine, NOT yet MT5-confirmed) `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D4.set` (in Presets, flush-left):**
D3-noE4 **+ `E1_MIN_MOMENTUM_ADX` 19.5→23 + `E2_MAX_TOUCH_AGE` 36→60**. Both are ENTRY filters (the side
the engine models faithfully) → should translate to MT5. Engine ALL +1247→**+1695 / PF 1.42**, Sharpe
2.47→**3.12**, OOS +251→**+293**, per-quarter keeps BOTH 2026 quarters positive (26Q1 +202, 26Q2 +91).
Levers ADDITIVE (e1e2b: S1+ADX23 +1397, S2+TA60 +1470, S3 both +1695). REJECTED: `min_TQ_E1=8` (redundant
w/ ADX23), `E1_RR=1.5` (pooled-OOS +353 illusion — per-quarter 26Q2 FLIPS to −98). ATRpct70 + sideways45
already optimal; E1 HTF-DI & low min_TQ inert; cross-age 100-120 = overfit trap.

▶️ **NEXT ACTIONS (in priority order):**
1. **MT5-confirm D4** — run KenKemExpert (XAU M1, 2025.03.02–2026.05.29, every-tick) w/ `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D4.set`.
   Auto-collect→diff vs engine /tmp-style (use `cpp_core/build/kenkem/tick_backtester --set <D4.set> --symbol-xau
   --out X.trades.csv`, then time-align by (minute,dir,kind)). Expect ~+1100–1300 if entry-faithfulness holds.
   If confirmed, D4 becomes the new lock (update preset name + memory + this section).
2. **E5 evaluation (user explicitly asked why E5 was ignored — it was wrongly dismissed on engine numbers).**
   ✅ PRESET READY: `KK-KenKem-XAUUSD-M1-D4-E5.set` (D4 + `ENABLE_E5_ENTRIES=true`, flush-left, staged in
   Presets). Engine reference (DIRECTIONAL only — ~53% E5 recall + exit optimism, [[kenkem-e5-2026-selection-break]]):
   D4 148tr/+1695/PF1.419 → D4+E5 397tr/+2092/**PF 1.184** (E5's 248 tr = +435 @ PF~1.04, dilutes book +
   nibbles E1/E2 via slot contention). Engine says "dilutes", but it MISSES ~half of real E5 + the accidental
   first run = **E5-only +1019/331tr in MT5** → only MT5 settles it. **RUN #2 after D4:** Load D4-E5 preset,
   same XAU M1 2025.03.02–2026.05.29 every-tick; SHIP E5 only if E1+E2+E5 beats D4 on BOTH net AND PF.
3. **Engine E4 intrabar-exit fix** — so future E4/E2 exit sweeps are trustworthy (per-tick barrier check at
   `cpp_core/include/kk/kenkem/trade_manager.hpp:110-114` looks correct; suspect entry-bar arming / exit
   granularity or trail level. The MAE stub should also be implemented for diagnosis). Unlocks revisiting E4.
- Stubborn losers in EVERY config: 25Q1 (sparse early data) + 25Q3 (summer chop) — a session/vol filter is
  the likely lever there (untested).

## 🟢 KenKem E4 — FIRST PARITY DIFF → SL-cap bug fixed → recall 78.7%→94.3% (2026-06-20, commit af8b798)
First-ever E4 benchmark (engine vs `RUN_2026-06-19_..._E4only`, 244 MT5 trades; feed the run's
`inputs_echo.txt` DIRECTLY as `--set` — section headers parse to empty keys, harmless; zero transcription risk).
- **ROOT (systematic): engine SL +39.5% too wide in 190/192 matched** (pinned to the 4.0×ATR cap; MT5 ~2.9×ATR).
  The EA's `CalculateStopLossWithCustomEMA` (EntryBase.mqh) picks cap/floor via `(entryType==1)?E1:E2` →
  **entryType=4 falls through to E2 (cap 3.0/floor 1.1); the `E4_ATR_SL_*` inputs are PARSED but DEAD.**
  Engine had faithfully coded the *documented* 4.0/1.25. Fixed `atr_sl_caps(kind==4)`→e2 bounds.
- **CASCADE (wider SL was binding occupancy/risk limiters, suppressing entries):** matched **192→230 (94.3%)**,
  missed 52→14, overfire 23→24, |Δrisk(SL)| median 0.93→**0.166**, |ΔpnlUSD| median 12.96→**7.96**, exact-min 230/230.
- **E4 recall now MAXED** (with E1 93% / E2 96%): the 14 missed net **−409 (4/14 win, EA-cut losers)** — don't chase.
  Residual SL bias +5.9% = the shared forming-vs-closed ATR floor (E1/E2 have it too; untouched). E1/E2 byte-identical.
- Added `test_e4_sl_uses_e2_cap`. ▶️ **E4 exits not yet diffed** (matched |Δpnl| 7.96 is small; lower priority).
  Next per user's pick: **E1 22-not-armed overfire** (mine committed `kke1arm.csv.gz` vs engine `triggers.hpp`).

## 🟢 KenKem E5 — real-path trace COLLECTED → 1 fix shipped (+8 recall) → residual decomposed (2026-06-20)
_Real-path E5 entry trace ran clean: `mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-20_1.8.154_xau_2026H1_E5only_realtrace/`
(`realtrace_*.csv` = 4,914 armed/fired E5 bar snapshots w/ the LIVE per-bar `final_decision`; 108 E5 +949).
Engine repro (commit **2f5143c**, `MT5_E5_2026.set`, `--from-ms 1767225600000 --to-ms 1780272000000`).
Full writeup: **`research/kenkem_parity/E5_REALTRACE_FINDINGS.md`**._

_**✅ FIX SHIPPED — `hr_momentum_level(E5)` = NONE (risk_exec.hpp).** EA `Entry5::GetHighRiskMomentumCheck()`
is hardcoded `NONE` (InputParams.mqh NONE=-1) → the E5 high-risk route applies NO momentum gate; the engine
had no kind==5 case so it fell through to `c.hr_momentum_e1`=3 (M1_AND_M3), wrongly filtering E5 HR entries.
**matched 49→57, missed 59→51, recall 45.4→52.8%** (recovered 8 of the 40 HIGH_RISK_ROUTE misses). Golden 28/28._

_**✅ RESIDUAL 51 missed VALUE-DIFFED (v2cols run, this session) — decomposition OVERTURNED.** The richer
realtrace (10 new gate-INPUT cols, kenkem `ebd1bde`) + 2 new env-gated engine dumps (`KK_E5_VALDUMP`:
E5V=M1 EMA stack@B-1/B-2/B-3 + alignment verdict; E5D=M1/M5/M15 DI+ADX closed&forming) → tool
`diff_e5_valuediff.py`. The prior "26 unarmed + 15 htf + 7 trend_core" was a MISATTRIBUTION:_
- _**42 M1 onset/arming** — engine never arms the M1 4-EMA strict-alignment onset (the near-sole root)._
- _**1 htf** — engine M5 **closed** adx/di == EA realtrace EXACTLY (20.7,20.0,17.6); NOT an HTF value diff._
- _**2 trend_core / 2 armed-pass / 4 nojoin** — negligible. HTF & trend-core were arming misclassifications._

_**ROOT (proven, NOT a value/seeding bug):** the onset BAR-PAIRING. `KK_E5_VALDUMP` shift-test → the EA's
logged alignment `ema25` matches the engine stack at **B-1 (m1s1) EXACTLY 42/42** (engine EMA values are
correct == MT5 at the same bar), but the engine onset reads **B-2 (m1s2, faithful)**. **BUT a naive global
fresh shift REGRESSES** (`KK_E5_FRESH_ONSET`: recall 52.8→41.7%, matched 57→45, overfire 33→53) — arming &
fire are coupled, faithful B-2 is net-best. The 42 are marginal near-tie alignment bars._

_**Worth chasing:** the 51 missed MT5 trades net **+466 (53% win)** — REPRESENTATIVE of the full E5 edge
(+949/52%), unlike E1's all-loser misses. Recovering ≈ half the E5 P&L. Full writeup: `E5_REALTRACE_FINDINGS.md`._

### ▶️ NEXT for E5 — DECISION POINT (recall is at the faithful 52.8% ceiling)
The 42 onset misses need the EA's **exact latch internals**, not a shift (the shift regressed). To port
MT5's precise `aligned@cur && !aligned@prv` pairing, the realtrace must add `m_prevBullishAligned`/
`m_prevBearishAligned` (prior-bar alignment) + `m_lastBullishSignal`/`m_lastBearishSignal` (armed-bar idx).
**Options:** (A) add those 4 cols to RealTrace.mqh + 1 more MT5 run → port the exact latch (regression risk,
real +466 edge); (B) accept the 52.8% faithful ceiling and move to **E1/E2/E4** parity (per user's E5→E1
directive). _Recommend B unless the user wants to push E5 recall._ Engine instruments + analysis committed.

## 🎯 (KenKem) Goal: optimize E5 then E1 (user directive). Parity first (foundation), then param sweep.
Ground truth E5 = `research/kenkem_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-19_1.8.154_xau_2yr_E5only_cd120/`
(trades.csv 656 trades net +1267 PF 1.10; trace.csv.gz per-bar E5 TraceBar; inputs_echo.txt).

## ▶️ THIS SESSION (2026-06-20) — E5 entry onset FIXED; E5 exit parity is the next blocker
1. **[committed d1704ab] E5 onset off-by-one** — `triggers.hpp` E5 read M1 alignment at B-1/B-2 (1 bar
   too fresh); MT5's trapped GetEMA → onset = aligned@B-2 && !aligned@B-3. Gated on `kFaithful`
   (e5_cur=m1s2, e5_prv=m1s2-1). Result (MT5_E5_ONLY.set vs E5only_cd120):
   matched **295→399**, missed 361→257, overfire 344→233, exact-minute **66→342**, |Δentry| **0.286→0**.
   See memory [[kenkem-e5-onset-trap-fix]]. Tool added: `research/kenkem_parity/diff_e5_trace.py`.
2. **[DIAGNOSED, not fixed] E5 EXIT parity = the P&L gap.** On 399 matched trades: tag-agree 61%,
   engine net **−489 vs MT5 +733** (Δ −1222). Per-cell P&L drain:
   - **EA→SL-LOSS (67): Δ −1826** — MT5 cuts losers early ("EA"); engine rides to full SL. #1 drain.
   - **TP→SL-WIN (25): Δ −1050** — engine trails too tight, exits before MT5 reaches TP.
   - (the full MT5-"EA" row nets ~even +21; the killers are specifically EA→SL-LOSS and TP→SL-WIN.)
   ROOT (partly localized): `exits.hpp:55-63` `panic_exit_enabled`/`score_drop_enabled` for E5
   FALL THROUGH to the E1 flags (stale comment "E3/E5 not used"). In the E5 set E1-panic=true so panic
   IS on, but fidelity differs (per-tick vs once-per-bar ADX-collapse; unmodeled `minADXToHold=18`
   hold-exit + `ENABLE_PRE_BE_STRUCTURE_PROTECTION=true` PRE_BE_TRIGGER_R=0.5 structure SL move +
   E5_TRAILING_SL_FACTOR=0.38 / E5_PARTIAL_TP_TRIGGER=0.8 trailing). Needs E5-specific exit fields +
   panic/pre-BE/trail parity pass.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTIONS (in order)
1. **E5 exit parity**: add `panic_exit_e5`/`score_drop_e5`/`di_flip_e5` config fields + parse
   `ENABLE_*_E5`; route `panic_exit_enabled(5)`→e5 flag. Then attack EA→SL-LOSS (panic ADX-collapse
   fidelity / minADXToHold=18 hold-exit) and TP→SL-WIN (trailing/PRE-BE). Re-diff with
   `matched_exit_crosstab.py`; target matched-net sign-match + tag-agree >80%.
2. **Then E5 sweep** on the C++ engine over real ticks (existing harness: `research/optimization/
   sweep_e5_exits.py`; 9-col table via `report_metrics.py`). Lock best combo in a `.set` under
   `kenkem/MQL5/Presets`. Candidate knobs: E5_MAX_EMA_CROSS_AGE, MIN_TREND_QUALITY_E5,
   E5_MIN_MOMENTUM_ADX, E5_RR, E5_HTF_*, trailing/partial, MIN_ENTRY_ATR_PERCENTILE.
3. Then repeat for E1 (entry parity already ~93%; focus E1 exits + sweep).
4. After E1→E5 locked: pip→ATR-relative per `docs/PIP_TO_ATR_INVENTORY.md`. NOT before.

## ▶️ THIS SESSION — re-ran E1/E2 on this machine; found+fixed the real E1 blocker
Fresh baseline on complete data (162.7M ticks, ~24s/run), all matches exact-minute (pure selection problem):

| Kind | Window | MT5 | Eng | Matched | Missed | Overfire | Recall |
|------|--------|-----|-----|---------|--------|----------|--------|
| E1 | Full      | 183 | 238 | **171** | 12 | 67 | **93.4%** |
| E1 | Gap-free  |  82 | 107 |  **78** |  4 | 29 | **95.1%** |
| E2 | Full      | 142 | 159 | **136** |  6 | 23 | **95.8%** |
| E2 | Gap-free  |  69 |  79 |  **65** |  4 | 14 | **94.2%** |

**ROOT CAUSE of the old "E1 50% recall" = a single config mismatch, NOT an engine bug.**
- `anchor_E1E2.set` had `E1_MAX_CROSS_AGE=28` but the MT5 run echoed **80**. (28 was a live-trading
  "cut over-trading" cap baked into both the set and `kenkem_config.hpp:199` default.) A full set-vs-echo
  diff showed this was the **ONLY** value mismatch of 193 keys.
- Effect: engine expired armed crosses at age 28 while MT5 held them to 80 → MT5 fired E1 on bars the
  engine had already dropped. **Fixed set → E1 recall 50%→93.4%** (matched 92→171, missed 91→12). E2 unchanged.
- Diagnostic that nailed it (reproducible): categorized the old 91 missed E1 via `KK_EMIT_GATE_REASON`:
  56 = armed-then-expired (cross-age!), 18 = never-armed, only **17 gate-blocks (1 sideways)**. The prior
  HANDOFF's "sideways over-block, highest-leverage" was wrong — sideways blocks 1 of 91.
- Also corrected: the "E1↔E2 interaction (78→183 E1)" was a **lot-size artifact** — the E1-only set runs
  `MY_STANDARD_LOT_SIZE=100` (MT5 account limiters choke E1 to 78), the E1E2 set runs 0.15 (limiters off,
  183 fire). Not a real entry interaction.

## 🟡 RESIDUAL = E1 overfire (68 full / 29 gap-free) — NOW LOCALIZED at trade level. E2 overfire 23/14.
Using the new MT5 gate trace (`RUN_2026-06-19_..._E1E2_gatetrace/kke1gate.csv`, 104k per-armed-bar E1
verdicts, aligned at engine = MT5 + 60s), each of the 68 overfire trades was matched to MT5's verdict:
- **41/68 = MT5_BLOCK:mtf** → the engine's MTF (M3/M5 EMA-alignment) gate is too PERMISSIVE; MT5 armed the
  cross and blocked it on MTF, the engine passed & fired. Confusion matrix: 240 bar-evals engine-PASS where
  MT5=mtf (+10 trend_quality); EVERY other gate matches ~100% (htf 58,672/58,832, price_pos/momentum/
  trend_strength/rsi_div clean). NOT a shift bug — M3/M5 reads already use `align_tf-2` (gates.hpp:88,94).
  It's genuine M3/M5 EMA VALUE divergence near the `tol` band.
- **~~22/68 = MT5_not_armed~~ → CORRECTED (2026-06-20): only ~8, and NOT phantom arms.** Cross-referencing
  each of the 67 current overfire against the actual `kke1arm.csv.gz` arm-state at the entry bar: **0 had
  MT5 armU/armD = −1** (the gate-trace "not_armed" label conflated expired/consumed arms). 59/67 = MT5
  DID arm → downstream block (the 41 MTF + ATR/limiter exec). The remaining **8 are arm-TIMING offsets on
  REAL crosses** (engine-early detection e.g. 2024-02-21 13:15 fires 8min before MT5's armU=0@13:23;
  re-arm-after-age-80-expiry e.g. 2025-04-29; one opposite-dir). Net **+377 engine-FAVORABLE, 5/8 wins** →
  NOT worth a fix (regression risk on the 171 matched, heterogeneous, no single bug). The 59 armed-gate
  overfire net only +35 (near-neutral). **CONCLUSION: E1 overfire has NO clean local fix; the only
  actionable lever is the MT5 M3/M5 EMA-at-entry dump (item 3) for the 41 MTF value-diff.**
- 5/68 = MT5_PASS (benign timing/occupancy near-miss).
- Reverse (engine BLOCK where MT5 PASS) is tiny: 8 conviction + 2 mtf + 1 tq = the engine-only conviction
  gate slightly over-blocks → a minor missed-entry source.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTIONS (in order)
1. **[committed]** `E1_MAX_CROSS_AGE=80` in `anchor_E1E2.set` (E1 recall 50→93%). `kenkem_config.hpp:199`
   default stays 28 (live-trading opt) — parity is driven by the `.set`.
2. **[ENGINE, no new MT5 data]** Mine `kke1arm.csv.gz` vs the engine's E1 arm decisions to fix the 22
   MT5_not_armed overfire (cross-detection divergence). diff against the engine's cross-arm logic
   (`triggers.hpp` ema cross arming).
3. **[USER]** One MT5 re-run dumping **M3/M5 EMA1..4 at ENTRY_SHIFT** (the BarTrace lacks them — only M1
   ema0..4 + per-TF ADX/DI present). Needed to value-diff the 41 MTF-gate overfire. This is the long-standing
   M3/M5-alignment ceiling, now pinpointed to exactly the MTF gate.
4. **✅ E4 DONE** (commit af8b798, recall 94.3%) — see the E4 section at the top. Entry recall maxed;
   E4 exits not yet diffed (low priority, matched |Δpnl| 7.96 already small).
5. After E1→E5 LOCKED: pip→ATR-relative per `docs/PIP_TO_ATR_INVENTORY.md`. NOT before.

## 📁 NEW: MT5 gate-trace run (committed this session)
`research/kenkem_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-19_1.8.154_xau_2yr_E1E2_gatetrace/` — from
`MT5_E1E2_GATETRACE.set` (≡ reference run + E1_GATE_TRACE/E1_ARM_TRACE). trades.csv (325, **byte-identical
to the reference** → trace didn't perturb logic), kke1gate.csv (104,221), kke1arm.csv.gz (509,662),
trace.csv.gz (per-bar BarTrace), tester.log.gz, inputs_echo.txt. Confusion tool: `diff_gate_reason.py`.
