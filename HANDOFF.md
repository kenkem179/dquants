# HANDOFF — read me first, update me last

_Last updated: 2026-06-18 by Claude (Opus 4.8). Branch `reliableBaseline`. Build GREEN, 28 C++ checks pass._
_Anchor = 2yr E1E2 (`research/kenkem_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-18_1.8.154_xau_2yr_E1E2/`). NOTE: that
reference run used E1_MAX_CROSS_AGE=80; we just changed the param to 28 (see below) so the reference is
now STALE for E1 parity — a fresh MT5 run at age=28 is needed to re-validate._

## 🎯 Current goal: Phase A6 — KenKem E1E2 parity gate
Repro (full 2yr ≈ 20s, 162M ticks). `KK_EMIT_AGE=1` adds per-fire `AGEFIRE,ts,dir,kind,age` to stderr:
```
cd cpp_core && make kenkem_tick
KK_EMIT_AGE=1 ./build/kenkem/tick_backtester --bars-m1 tools/bars_xauusd_2024_2026_m1.csv \
  --ticks tools/ticks_xauusd_2024_2026.csv --symbol-xau \
  --set ../research/kenkem_parity/anchor_E1E2.set --from-ms 1704067200000 --to-ms 1780272000000 \
  --out /tmp/e.csv 2>/tmp/age.log

  --engine /tmp/e.csv --mt5 research/kenkem_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-18_1.8.154_xau_2yr_E1E2/trades.csv
```

## ✅ DONE this session — E1_MAX_CROSS_AGE 80 → 28 (per user instruction, both codebases)
Set in: `cpp_core/.../kenkem_config.hpp:193`, `research/kenkem_parity/anchor_E1E2.set`, and the ORIGINAL EA
`kenkem/.../KenKem/Config/InputParams.mqh:303`. Effect on C++: E1 624→561 (only −63 — faster expiry makes
the engine RE-ARM more, 7289→8428 arms, largely offsetting). So the cap alone does NOT fix over-fire.
**ACTION FOR USER: recompile + re-run MT5 at age=28 to produce a fresh E1E2 reference for true parity.**

## 🔁 MAJOR RE-DIAGNOSIS this session — the HANDOFF's prior 2 leads were TRACE-TOOLING ARTIFACTS
Both "strongest leads" from last session are DEBUNKED (verified, do NOT re-chase):
1. **"trend_core disagreement (L_tcore cpp=6 vs mt5=0)" = INVALID COMPARISON.** The MT5 `BarTrace`
   `L_tcore` is populated inside **Entry5**'s detect (`Entry5.mqh:485`): `L_tcore=(bull&&!bear)?1:0` — E5's
   EMA-alignment gate (0/1). The C++ `trace_dumper` writes `trend_core_score` (E1 DI gate, 0–6). Two
   DIFFERENT gates. The whole trace's gate columns (L_pass/L_tcore/L_htf…) are **E5 semantics**, useless
   for E1/E2 diagnosis.
2. **"Pervasive DI drift = root cause" = 1-BAR TRACE LABELING ARTIFACT.** Empirical: `ema0` matches at
   shift 0 (mean|Δ|=0.0024) but `diP_m1/diM_m1/adx_m1` match at **shift +1 (mean|Δ|≈0.0001)** — exact
   parity once aligned. Cause: `trace_dumper` labels rows by the FORMING bar; the EA `BarTrace` labels by
   the shift-1 bar (`Entry5.mqh:534`). DI/ADX formula is EXACT. The real `tick_engine` reads DI at shift 1
   and EMA at shift 2 (`snapshot.hpp:106,124`), faithfully matching the EA (DI via `getDIPlus` series-shift1;
   EMA via the `GetEMA` non-series trap series-shift2). **Engine indicators are faithful. Stop chasing DI.**

## 🧭 The REAL problem — E1 entry SELECTION is desynced, NOT "late firing"
Per-fire age instrumentation (`KK_EMIT_AGE=1`) + `diff_kk` matching (E1, age-80 baseline 624 vs MT5 183):
- **86 matched / 97 MISSED / 538 OVERFIRE.** Engine simultaneously misses HALF of MT5's real E1 trades
  AND adds 538 spurious ones — they fire at largely DIFFERENT bars.
- **Over-fire is NOT late-firing:** MATCHED engine trades skew HIGH age (median 24, 50/86 at age 21–80);
  OVERFIRE trades lean LOW age (median 7, 124 at age 0–1). So clamping max-age kills REAL matches while
  keeping spurious low-age fires — the old "AGE sweep lever" hit the right COUNT for the WRONG reason.
- Overfire is **net-losing** (40% win, −$1307) vs MT5 E1 (56% win, +$3069); spread in time (median gap
  1.8 days — NOT a re-entry storm / cooldown issue).
- ⚠️ **matched-COUNT is an unreliable metric** (it fooled the AGE sweep AND likely the earlier
  "EMA-shift rejected 155→130"). Always judge by matched **+ missed + overfire + pnl**, not count alone.

## 🚨 STRONGEST LEAD now — E1 ARMING-BAR divergence (touch vs cross), with MT5 ground truth in hand
MT5 tester.log (`tester.log.gz`, **UTF-16**) logs arm events directly:
`gunzip→decode utf-16, regex "(\d4.\d2.\d2 \d2:\d2):\d2\s+\[EMA200 Touch\] (Bull|Bear)ish"`.
- **MT5 arms E1 almost entirely via EMA200-TOUCH: 7987 touch-arms logged** (4686 bull + 3301 bear),
  ~0 cross-arm lines (cross arming has no Print). 7119 "Expired stale" + 183 fires reconcile.
- Offset is **UTC+0** (log bar-times already UTC): 142/183 MT5 fires reconcile to a same-dir touch-arm at
  age 0–80 (median age **40** — MT5 ALSO fires late, so late-firing is normal). The other ~41 fires are
  cross-armed (recent). So MT5 E1 ≈ **78% touch-armed, 22% cross-armed**.
- ⚠️ **CORRECTION:** `tester.log.gz` contains **3 concatenated tester runs** (input echo at 00:24/00:27/00:32),
  so the raw 7987 touch lines are inflated 3×. **Deduped: MT5 has 2761 unique touch-arm bars (L1619/S1142).**
  The saved `mt5_e1_touch_arms_utc.csv` already de-dups to 2761 (set-keyed).

## 🧪 ROUND-2 (this session, age=80 to match MT5) — touch-arm shift & wick hypotheses REJECTED
Built consumption-aware engine arm emit (`KK_EMIT_ARMS=1` → `ARMFIRE,ts,dir,src{cross|touch}`) and
bar-matched vs MT5's 2761 touch arms (engine run on `/tmp/anchor_age80.set`, src-split: cross 3704, touch 3585):
- Engine **over**-touch-arms (3585 vs 2761, +30%); exact-bar overlap only **~72%** (L 74%, S 69%).
- **EMA200-touch read-SHIFT REJECTED:** `KK_TOUCH_SHIFT` sweep 0/1/2 moves overlap only 72→73→75% — NOT
  the cause. Do not change the touch shift.
- **Wick-fidelity REJECTED:** engine M1 `close/high/low` match MT5 to **0.0000** (at the +1 trace label
  shift; raw 0.74 was the same labeling artifact as DI). Bars are exact.
- **E1 HTF filter is a faithful 1:1 port** (EA enum `HTF_TREND_MODE` == engine `HtfMode`; mode 1=M5_ONLY;
  block-counter logic matches). Not the divergence.
- **Net:** bars + indicators + E1 gates + arming LOGIC are each individually faithful, yet entry sets still
  diverge (86/183 matched). The residual must be **stateful trigger COUPLING** — guard (`==-1`) +
  consumption + expiry + intra-bar arm/fire ORDERING — where small timing diffs compound the trigger state
  apart. The 72% touch overlap is largely DOWNSTREAM of this (different fire/expiry history → different bars
  eligible to arm), not an independent root.

## 🎯 ROUND-3 (this session) — OVER-FIRE DECOMPOSED via MT5 arm-bar reconstruction (DECISIVE)
Reconstructed MT5's true E1 arm bars from `tester.log.gz`: expiry lines (`Expired stale … age N`) give
`arm_idx = expiry_idx − N` (recovers the UNLOGGED cross-arms) + touch arms + fire bars → 2143 L / 1620 S.
Method validated: **97% of MATCHED engine trades** sit on a reconstructed MT5-armed bar (control). Then:
- **68% of the 538 OVERFIRE trades fire on a bar where MT5 had NO armed E1 trigger** (age≤80, same dir) →
  the engine ARMS where MT5 does not.
- **32% fire where MT5 WAS armed but did NOT fire** → a SILENT gate block (MTF 31% / momentum / RSI-div —
  these use `TrackEntryAttempt` with NO per-bar Print; only HTF & ADX are logged per-bar) or occupancy.
- **Mechanism = feedback loop:** the engine fires on the 32% "seed" bars (MT5 armed, silent gate blocks it)
  → consumes+clears the trigger → re-arms sooner → fires again → manufactures the 68% spurious-arm bars.
  (Confirmed: HTF is NOT the leak — 0% of overfire bars are MT5 HTF-block bars; engine HTF is faithful.)

## 🎯 SCOPE NARROWED (user, 2026-06-18): E1 PERFECT PARITY FIRST, then E2/E4/E5 later.
Reference must be **E1-ONLY** (E2 off) so the trade diff isolates E1. Old anchor was E1+E2 → contaminated.

## ✅ E1-ONLY gate-trace MT5 run LANDED + DECOMPOSED (2026-06-18) — prior diagnosis OVERTURNED
Run saved: `research/kenkem_parity/mt5_runs/RUN_2026-06-18_1.8.154_xau_E1only_trace/` (trades.csv 42, trace.csv,
tester.log.gz UTF-16, **kke1gate.csv** = 33790 parsed gate rows, UTF-8, fast to reuse). Instrumentation
(`E1_GATE_TRACE`, `Entry1.mqh`) worked: 33790 `KKE1GATE,<ts>,<L|S>,<BLOCK|PASS>,<gate>,<detail>` lines.
⚠️ **Run caveats:** (a) window is **2025.01.02→2026.05.29 only** (tester From-date was 2025, NOT 2024) — a
full-2yr E1-only re-run is still needed for FINAL parity sign-off; diagnosis below holds on the overlap.
(b) log has **2 concatenated tester passes** (dedup by set — done).

Engine E1-only (`--set anchor_E1_only_trace.set`, E2–E5 off → 561 E1 / 0 others) vs MT5, windowed by `diff_kk`:
**MT5 42 · engine 296 · matched 22 · MISSED 20 · OVERFIRE 274.** Then probed each overfire bar against the
direct MT5 gate trace (`/tmp/seed_probe.py`, ±2min same-dir):
- **231 / 274 (84%) = engine OVER-ARMS** — fires where MT5 had NO armed E1 trigger at all. *(DOMINANT)*
- **29 / 274 (11%) = MT5 also gate-PASSED but did not execute** → downstream ACCOUNT LIMITER / occupancy
  (conviction, MAX_CONCURRENT, session/daily-loss, ATR-pctile, cooldown) — a SEPARATE parity layer, not a gate.
- **14 / 274 (5%) = MT5 gate-BLOCKED** (the true silent-gate seed) — **13 of 14 = `mtf`**; rest htf/adx/momentum.
- Overfire AGE profile (`/tmp/seed_age.py`): median **3**, 61@age0-1 + 144@age2-9 + 69@age10-28, **0 above cap** →
  the over-arming is **low-age FRESH CROSS-arms**, not stale/touch.

🔑 **CORRECTED ROOT CAUSE:** E1 over-fire is **~84% spurious CROSS-ARMING**, not gate leakage. The earlier
"68% spurious-arm / 32% silent-gate (feedback loop)" reconstruction OVER-weighted the silent gate (really 5%).
The `mtf` gate is a minor (5%) contributor; the downstream limiters are a real-but-separate 11%.

## ▶️ NEXT ACTION (exact, priority order)
1. **Fix the cross-arm geometry — this is 84% of the bug.** Reconstruct MT5's true E1 cross-arm bars from the
   now-available expiry lines (`Expired stale … age N` → `arm_idx = expiry_idx − N`) + fires, in
   `RUN_..._E1only_trace/tester.log.gz`, and diff bar-for-bar against the engine's cross-arm bars
   (`KK_EMIT_ARMS=1` src=cross; engine arms cross 4490 / touch 4141). Audit `cpp_core/.../triggers.hpp:64–84`
   (cross detection) + the consumption/`==-1` guard + re-arm timing — the engine arms fresh EMA75 crosses MT5
   does not. (Engine touch-arms 4141 < MT5 ~5930/run, so the leak is CROSS, consistent with low-age profile.)
2. The 5% `mtf` seed: only after arming ties out — re-examine `emas_ready_entry` `align_tf−3` with PER-BAR EMA.
3. The 11% limiter gap (`MT5 passed but didn't execute`) → port the account-layer limiters (A-later).
4. **Get a full-2yr E1-only re-run** from user (From=2024.01.01) for final E1 parity sign-off.

Reusable instruments: `RUN_..._E1only_trace/kke1gate.csv` (per-bar gate decisions), `/tmp/seed_probe.py`
(overfire decomposition), `/tmp/seed_age.py` (age profile), `diff_kk.py` (matched/missed/overfire).

## 🧰 Tooling (all env-gated, non-regressive — default OFF reproduces baseline E1 624)
- `KK_EMIT_AGE=1` → tick backtester emits `AGEFIRE,ts_ms,dir,Ekind,age` per fire (EntrySignal.age).
- `KK_EMIT_ARMS=1` → emits `ARMFIRE,ts_ms,dir,src{cross|touch}` per E1 arm WITH consumption
  (`tick_engine.hpp` `on_bar_closed_`). This is the consumption-aware arm dump (use over `e1_arm_dumper`).
- `KK_TOUCH_SHIFT=N` → offsets the EMA200/alignment read in the touch arming (`triggers.hpp:86`); sweep
  showed flat overlap → keep 0.
- `cpp_core/tools/kenkem/e1_arm_dumper.cpp` — standalone consumption-FREE arm dumper (undercounts; prefer
  `KK_EMIT_ARMS`).
- MT5 touch-arm extraction (UTF-16, de-dup 3 runs): `gzip.open(...,'rb').read().decode('utf-16')` + regex
  `(\d4.\d2.\d2 \d2:\d2):\d2\s+\[EMA200 Touch\] (Bull|Bear)ish` → set-key (ts,dir).

## 🔑 Key facts / gotchas
- Full 2yr run FAST (~20s). Tick engine only for P&L. `anchor_E1E2.set` = MT5 config (now E1 age=28).
- Data: `cpp_core/tools/{bars_xauusd_2024_2026_m1.csv, ticks_xauusd_2024_2026.csv}` (3-digit gold).
  from/to ms = 1704067200000 / 1780272000000.
- tester.log.gz is **UTF-16** (Python `gzip.open(...,'rb').read().decode('utf-16')`; shell `grep -a`).
- Engine indicators (EMA/ADX/DI) are MT5-EXACT — divergence is in ENTRY logic (arming/gates), not numbers.
- ✅ TICK-SOURCE PARITY PROVEN EXACT (2026-06-18): MT5 tester.log modeled **162,657,649 ticks /
  848,532 bars**; engine CSV over the EA-active window (ts_ms ≥ 2024-01-03 00:00 = 1704240000000)
  = **162,657,649, exact to the tick** (the +103,586 in the full file are all pre-EA warmup).
  Bars: 849,963 − 1,431 warmup = 848,532, exact. **Data source is NOT the blocker — do not
  re-suspect ticks/bars.** SDK-free verifier: `research/kenkem_parity/verify_tick_source_parity.py`.
  (MT5 Python SDK is Windows-only + only re-pulls the same base the CSV came from; tester.log
  count is authoritative.)
